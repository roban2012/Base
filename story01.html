Preface

The United States has largely withdrawn its forces from Iraq, and it has identified the
end of 2014 as the date when most forces will be out of Afghanistan. As U.S. forces
from those conflicts return home, the Department of Defense (DoD) is reviewing its
global basing structure to determine how it should be reconfigured to meet the strategic
needs of the country. Congress has also turned its attention to future basing, and
the conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY)
2012 contained the following language:
SEC. 347. STUDY ON OVERSEAS BASING PRESENCE OF UNITED
STATES FORCES.
(a) INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT. The Secretary of Defense shall commission
an independent assessment of the overseas basing presence of United States forces.
(b) CONDUCT OF ASSESSMENT. The assessment required by subsection
(a) may, at the election of the Secretary, be conducted by (1) a Federally-funded
research and development center (FFRDC); or (2) an independent, non-governmental
institute which is described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such Code, and has recognized
credentials and expertise in national security and military affairs appropriate
for the assessment.1
DoD asked RAND’s National Defense Research Institute (NDRI) to conduct
the requested independent assessment, and this report constitutes NDRI’s response to
that request.
This research was sponsored by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Policy and conducted within the International Security and Defense Policy Center
of the RAND National Defense Research Institute, a federally funded research and
development center sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Unified Combatant Commands, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the defense agencies,
and the defense Intelligence Community.

	<b><a name="T2">Summary</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

The United States is at an inflection point in its defense planning due to a number
of factors: the end of the Iraq War, the planned end of U.S. combat operations in
Afghanistan in 2014, increased emphasis on security commitments and threats in the
Pacific, and fiscal constraints. The 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance sets the course for
this shift and has significant implications for overseas military posture, which needs to
be designed to effectively and efficiently support the strategy as an integral component
of overall defense capabilities. To that end, the National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 directed the Department of Defense (DoD) to commission
an independent assessment of the overseas basing presence of U.S. forces. The legislation
specifically asked for an assessment of the location and number of forces needed
overseas to execute the national military strategy, the advisability of changes to overseas
basing in light of potential fiscal constraints and the changing strategic environment,
and the cost of maintaining overseas presence. DoD asked the RAND National
Defense Research Institute to carry out that independent analysis.1
Overseas posture should be designed as part of an integrated set of capabilities
to execute the U.S. defense strategy. The starting point for this analysis was the strategy
contained in the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and the development of an
understanding of the capabilities that posture brings to bear. These capabilities―the
benefits produced by overseas presence―include improving operational responsiveness
to contingencies, deterring adversaries and assuring allies, and facilitating security
cooperation with partner militaries. Posture also incurs risks associated with overseas
facilities, including uncertainty of access in time of need and the vulnerability of such
bases to attack from hostile states and nonstate actors, and costs. Basing U.S. forces
abroad increases costs even in countries that provide financial and other support, with
the amount varying by region and military service. To inform the assessment of overseas
forces, we examined how overseas posture translates to benefits, the risks it poses,
the cost of maintaining it, and how these costs would likely change were U.S. overseas
presence to be modified in different ways, for example, by changing from permanent
to rotational presence.


This examination revealed some aspects of U.S. posture that are fundamental to
carrying out the U.S. national security strategy. It also indicated that, beyond these
enduring posture needs, there are posture changes involving both increases and reductions
in overseas presence that could be advisable to consider, and these are identified
in this report. Additionally, by identifying the benefits, risks, and costs associated with
overseas posture, this report should inform more general deliberations about the U.S.
posture now and in the future.
Strategic Benefits of Overseas Posture
Contingency Responsiveness
In-place forces provide the immediate capabilities needed to counter major acts of
aggression by countries that the United States has identified as posing a substantial
military threat to U.S. interests. Forward-based U.S. forces should be configured to
provide the initial response necessary to prevent quick defeat while awaiting the arrival
of aerial, maritime, and ground reinforcements―the last of which travel mostly by
sealift. Initial response forces could be ground forces, such as those stationed in South
Korea, or air or maritime forces. However, if ground forces must deploy even for short
distances, the advantage gained from forward basing erodes or disappears if such forces
do not have collocated, dedicated lift. This is especially true for heavy forces, which
cannot deploy rapidly by air. In critical situations, lighter ground forces can deploy by
air from the United States almost as quickly as they can from within a region. Additional
aircraft can self-deploy, assuming they have access, and their support equipment
can be airlifted or prepositioned in the region. Only when equipment has been prepositioned
can heavy forces provide rapid reinforcement.
For smaller-scale contingencies, the starting location of lighter ground forces does
not meaningfully influence deployment responsiveness, provided en route air bases
with adequate throughput capacity are available. Overall response time, however, often
hinges on the throughput capacity of the destination airfield, especially in more austere
areas. Exceptions would be when multiple simultaneous events occur or other ongoing
operations limit aircraft availability for a new mission. Over the long term, purchasing
large fleets of intertheater cargo aircraft and forward basing overseas present alternative
paths for enabling rapid deployment in small-scale contingency situations. That is,
large lift fleets sized for major wars can support rapid response to globally distributed
smaller-scale contingencies. Maritime forces that establish presence in new areas where
events threaten U.S. interests can provide additional flexibility. These maritime forces
also complement land-based presence in regions of enduring concern, when tensions
rise. Forward, land-based presence does make a difference, however, for special operations
forces performing missions in which mere hours can make a difference.


The U.S. strategy calls for global capabilities, so posture decisions should maintain
an effective global en route infrastructure―facilities, access agreements, fuel storage,
and other assets. This infrastructure must include multiple routes to key regions to
ensure resiliency, to overcome the risks of natural and man-made disruptions, and to
increase overall capacity. The United States can maintain global expeditionary capabilities
and relatively rapid response capabilities as long as this infrastructure and a robust
fleet of strategic lift assets are maintained. Broadly distributed maritime presence also
strongly contributes to flexible rapid-response capabilities. A strategy that calls for protection
against identified threats that could lead to major, high-intensity conflict must
maintain some forces in place, supported by prepositioned equipment. In general, after
the initial phase of operations to stabilize or even resolve a situation, the response by
the U.S. military to a contingency of any substantial size will come primarily from
forces deployed from bases in the United States.
Deterrence and Assurance
While the U.S. overseas posture does contribute to deterring potential adversaries and
assuring friends and allies, it does not mean that all overseas facilities and forward
capabilities can be justified on this basis; they are not all equally important in this
regard. Deterrence relies on perceptions of the will of a nation and its abilities relevant
to a particular conflict. The overseas posture contributes to both these aspects.
The presence of U.S. forces in a region shows a commitment and U.S. interest in the
security of the area, which speaks to the willingness of the United States to become
involved in future conflicts to stabilize situations, secure U.S. interests, and protect the
global commons. The forces there also help by providing relevant capabilities. In our
assessment, the most important capability in this regard is an ability to prevent a quick
victory by an adversary that could change the security situation on the ground.
The U.S. military presence in a region also helps to assure allies. It is a physical
symbol of U.S. commitment to the security of a region, and in that sense, it can
become a factor in the strategic calculations of allies. Without that assurance, they
might make different choices that could influence a wide range of their strategic decisions:
security policy choices, including formal and informal alliances; diplomatic positions;
force structure choices; and budgetary decisions. While countries are no longer
faced with the binary choice of the Cold War―between aligning for or against the
Soviet Union―the United States still has an interest in harmonizing the security outlook
and choices of allies. A U.S. military presence in or near an ally’s territory can be
an important factor in building and sustaining alliance relationships.
Certain types of capabilities are more likely to contribute to deterrence than
others, particularly forces that can respond to prevent a quick victory and missiledefense
capabilities to defend allies from coercive attacks. In some areas, like South
Korea, this leads the United States to maintain continuous presence. In other areas, the
United States may not have a permanent presence but does seek to maintain an ability to respond in times of crisis. Forces that can respond quickly include several different
types of units―carrier strike groups (CSGs) and amphibious ready groups (ARGs)/
marine expeditionary units (MEUs)―give the United States presence in a number of
potentially unstable regions, a variety of combat aircraft can quickly deploy to areas
at risk, and Army airborne and some other units are configured to deploy quickly. For
some crises, these quickly deployable forces will be sufficient. In others, they will play a
role as an initial entry force, to be supported by larger deployments that take more time
to deploy. In either case, the en route mobility infrastructure allows the United States
to project substantial combat power around the globe, contributing to deterrence and
assurance.
Security Cooperation
Forces based overseas benefit from the interoperability and adaptability skills and the
greater cultural awareness gained from more frequent training with foreign partners.
These skills are also important for U.S.-based forces to develop through rotational and
temporary deployments. Security cooperation benefits the participating U.S. forces
by training them to operate with foreign forces, both technically and culturally. To
understand how military force can be used to build coalitions in support of U.S. interests
and to influence adversaries takes considerable understanding of the customs and
value systems of the foreign forces involved. Living and working on foreign soil offers
opportunities for U.S. forces to experience these differences in depth and incorporate
them into their skill set.
While the incremental costs of security cooperation activities are lower with U.S.
forces based overseas, the savings are not close to sufficient to offset the higher costs of
basing forces overseas. But, more important, security cooperation activities comprise a
very small fraction of the operating costs of U.S. forces based overseas, in part because
they can be combined with basic unit training needs or other activities. This low marginal
cost leads to much greater frequency of security cooperation than would otherwise
occur. In short, having overseas presence significantly increases the frequency and
range of security cooperation activities.
While U.S.-based forces are capable of building partner-nation security capabilities,
overseas basing is especially beneficial when conducting security cooperation activities
with more advanced militaries, for example, those in Europe and South Korea.
Forward basing helps strengthen personal and unit relationships, which are especially
important for coalition interoperability. Most important, it provides frequent opportunities
for intensive bilateral and multinational training, including specialized military
capabilities. For other types of training in many parts of the world (e.g., foreign internal
defense, peacekeeping, counterterrorism), use of rotational or temporary deployments
is likely to be more cost-effective.
Given that forward-based forces appear to get the greatest security cooperation
benefit from large-scale, multinational training, maintaining training facilities in Europe and enhancing those in the Pacific could be valuable. In Europe, while rotational
forces are planned to play a greater role in security cooperation, some level of
forward-based forces and facilities to house, support, and train rotational units are
important enablers. Substituting rotational forces for permanently stationed forces
could increase flexibility to conduct security cooperation globally and provide opportunities
for the benefits of security cooperation to accrue to a broader range of U.S.
and foreign forces. On the other hand, it would risk reducing the depth of relationships
and expertise that develop from more frequent security cooperation interactions engendered
by close, continuous proximity. The Army’s recent implementation of regionally
focused units could help reduce some of the disadvantage in this area.
Risks of Overseas Posture
Political Risks
While the U.S. forward presence provides strategic benefits, it also carries with it a
number of risks. U.S. peacetime military presence on foreign soil comes only with the
acquiescence of the host nation. Therefore, if a host nation revokes U.S. access, DoD
may be evicted from or prohibited from using bases where it has made significant
investments. During a crisis, for example, the host nation might restrict the use of its
facilities and territory. Access in a crisis should not be considered as binary (i.e., either
providing full access or nothing at all). In practice, it tends to be granted by degrees.
Some access limitations can be quite restrictive―for instance, limiting cooperation
to overflight rights or limiting the number of landings allowed. Others may allow for
some types of combat operations but not others, such as combat strike missions. Such
restrictions can have operational effects, hindering the effectiveness of U.S. operations.
Political access cannot be guaranteed in advance, even when formal agreements
exist, but there are factors that are likely to influence access decisions, such as the
level of overlapping threat perception and interest, host-nation domestic public opinion
about the conflict and the U.S. role in the conflict, and the perceived likelihood
of reprisals. Moreover, some of these negative factors are more likely to influence the
decisionmaking of unstable host nations. For example, if a host government faces significant
internal instability, this could lead to a politically constrained view of acceptable
U.S. access. While these access risks will endure, the United States can hedge
against them by having diversity in its global presence. Relationships and facilities in
several countries can provide alternatives if any one country chooses not to provide
access during a future crisis. Still, this diversity of access locations comes at a cost, so
carefully selecting the partners and the investments the United States makes in those
partner nations will be an important part of a successful implementation strategy. This
cost can be limited while mitigating some risk through the pursuit of access bases in some regions. Investments in these minimally manned access sites to enable future
U.S. operations could be thought of as a form of war reserve.
Operational Risks
In recent years, the advent of long-range precision-guided weapons has put at risk
a number of U.S. forces and facilities that previously enjoyed sanctuary, with further
increases in the accuracy of such threats on the horizon. Some adversaries will
have capabilities to inflict substantial damage on forward bases and forward-deployed
forces, such as CSGs. Several current U.S. overseas facilities already face a substantial
threat from these weapons―for instance, the accuracy and number of precisionguided
weapons China currently fields are highly advanced. As a result, of particular
concern is the large percentage of U.S. facilities that sit within high-threat areas, with
over 90 percent of U.S. air facilities in Northeast Asia within heavy-threat areas from
systems that China currently fields. While their capabilities are not currently as numerous
or accurate, Iran and North Korea are investing in building such capabilities, and
others could follow suit.
The impact of these weapons could be profound, potentially necessitating changes
to U.S. military concepts of operations and force structure, as well as adjustments to
basing and forward presence practices. If the United States is going to operate military
forces within range of large numbers of such systems, it may need to employ a diverse
strategy of active defenses, passive defenses, and either hardening or, when feasible,
dispersal to reduce the effectiveness of such weapons. Essentially, a strategy would be
for the United States to take away the easy and highly efficient use of such weapons,
especially considering their limited supply.
Violent Extremism Risks
The U.S. military has suffered attacks from a number of different violent extremist
groups. In considering risks to forward-deployed forces from violent extremist groups,
the security of the facilities is not the only consideration. In many cases, U.S. military
personnel will be most at risk when they are traveling outside of their work facility.
In many instances, assessments of previous violent extremist activity in the area will
be quite informative; however, such an assessment may miss the wider reach of some
groups that have a capability to conduct operations far away from their traditional base
of support.
Costs of Overseas Posture
In considering future posture changes, the condition of current facilities could influence
those decisions, if conditions are poor enough that closure avoids large, future
infrastructure reinvestments. Although the data on installation conditions are weak, when analyzed in combination with other qualitative evidence from U.S. military representatives
overseas, they suggest that installation conditions overseas are at least as
good as those in the United States and U.S. territories―possibly better. This implies
that, given the small differences in average conditions, restoration and modernization
needs in the United States would be about the same in relative terms for existing overseas
facilities.
Despite substantial host-nation financial and in-kind support, we found that stationing
forces and maintaining bases overseas does entail measurably higher direct
financial costs to DoD. Host-nation support―substantial from Japan and South
Korea (in terms of both in-kind support and cash payments) and from NATO allies
(mostly through indirect in-kind support)―offsets some, but not all, of the higher
costs of overseas basing, as well as the higher costs of having a more distributed basing
structure. If the U.S. overseas posture were to shift toward less-developed areas of the
world where resources are less plentiful, U.S. contributions could increase and those of
host nations could decline, although the lower cost of living in some such areas could
have a countervailing effect.
We found that there are annual recurring fixed costs to having a base open, ranging
from an estimated $50 million to about $200 million per year, depending on service
and region, with additional variable recurring costs depending on base size. This
is important because it means that, if forces were to be consolidated on fewer, larger
bases, whether in the United States or overseas, the fixed-cost portions of the closed
bases would be saved. There are efficiencies to be gained from using fewer, larger bases
rather than a more distributed posture. This effect, by itself, would be a significant contributor
to cost reductions were forces realigned from overseas or inactivated in place.
The fixed costs per base do not appear to be systematically higher overseas, with the
exception of the Air Force bases, compared with facilities in the United States.
In contrast, the recurring variable costs per person are systematically higher overseas
in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region due to higher allowances related to the cost
of living, higher permanent-change-of-station move costs, and the need to provide
schools more comprehensively, with the incremental overseas cost per person varying
widely from about $10,000 to close to $40,000 per year. The variation depends on service
and location, with factors such as dependent ratios, local cost of living, and housing
type driving these differences. Thus, the cost effects of posture changes depend
greatly on the service and region under consideration.
Combining analysis of variable costs with the fixed cost findings indicates that
consolidating forces at fewer bases would provide more savings when the forces move
to the United States and the overseas base closes, compared with consolidating two
overseas facilities. The fixed costs would be saved whether consolidating in the United
States or overseas, but closing an overseas base and consolidating in the United States
also reduces variable costs due to the incremental overseas personnel-related costs.
However, the United States cannot repurpose overseas bases like it can in the United States, and repurposing U.S. bases could produce non-DoD economic benefits. We
did not examine the benefits gained by the broader economy as the result of U.S. base
closures.
The One-Time Costs from Closing Bases and Restationing Forces
By far, the largest one-time transition cost for closing bases and restationing forces to
the United States would be the cost of construction when capacity limitations in the
United States result in the need for new facilities. These costs are not incurred, however,
if the units at the closed bases are inactivated as part of force reductions. These costs
are also avoided if the units returning to the United States can use facilities that are
vacated due to the inactivations of other units. Since the Army is planning to reduce its
overall force by 80,000 troops, and posture options contemplate only a fraction of that
number being realigned to the United States, we estimate lower and upper bounds for
the construction costs of realigning Army units to the United States. While the Marine
Corps is downsizing as well, the information we garnered indicates that any realignments
would require new facilities. We assume that the Air Force and Navy would also
have to expand their U.S. facilities if forces were realigned to the United States.
The Costs of Rotational Presence
As pressure has risen to consider reducing the permanent stationing of U.S. forces
overseas, rotational presence is being increasingly considered to provide for some of the
same benefits, because it is believed to be more efficient or at least less expensive. Our
analysis indicates that whether this hypothesis is correct and the degree of the cost difference
depends heavily on the rotational design (frequency and duration of rotations)
and the type of permanent presence change.
Generally, we found that the savings produced by only realigning forces from an
installation while keeping it open is not sufficient to offset the cost of providing full
presence through rotational deployments. In most cases, realignments of permanent
forces can underwrite only partial-year rotational presence in the same location. If an
installation is closed as well, this will usually provide some net savings, albeit limited
in some cases, even if the realigned unit is replaced with full-year rotational presence
to the region. The net savings depend greatly on the service, unit type, location, and
rotational design; for ground forces, sealift to move equipment or available equipment
for prepositioning is necessary for savings. Furthermore, if a base were to be closed and
its forces realigned, another permanent base in that country or region must be maintained
to support the rotating forces, or a host nation must agree to provide access to
one of its bases.
Note that our cost assessments of rotational presence include only the costs associated
with supporting and moving units and people, assuming no additions in force
structure would be needed to enable the rotations. Sustaining rotational presence in
a location requires a “rotation” base in the force structure to enable personnel tempo goals, such as time at home between deployments, to be met. This report does not
examine the associated constraints on increasing rotational presence by unit type and
service. If additional units had to be added to the force structure to support rotations,
this would add substantially to the rotational presence costs presented in this report
and would likely make rotational presence more expensive than permanent basing in a
location when the latter is an option.
Opportunities for Efficiencies and Reducing Costs
These cost considerations do suggest opportunities for efficiency, through two paths.
The first is increased centralization, which is already being implemented in South
Korea and Europe. The second is achieving presence through one or two long rotations
per year to a location, accompanied by base closures while retaining at least one base
with operating support in a region. Both of these should be considered in light of any
negative effects and other objectives. In particular, more distributed forces can provide
strategic advantages, long rotations could negatively affect quality of life, and consolidation
could be detrimental in areas under high threat of precision-guided missiles.
Foundational Elements of Overseas Posture
The examination of strategic benefits made it clear that there are several elements of
overseas posture that are vital for successful execution of the strategic guidance. A
robust global en route infrastructure, in conjunction with substantial lift fleets and
other global enablers, such as communications capabilities, provides the foundation for
a global response capability that can leverage the entire force. This is complemented by
the Navy and Marine Corps’ at-sea deployments. In-place forces where major attacks
are considered possible threats to U.S. security interests or allies are essential to deter
high-end threats and prevent quick defeats in the event of aggression. The United
States has also made commitments to some key allies to provide them with air and
missile defense, necessitating forward ground and maritime forces to provide these
capabilities. The combination of mandates to uphold commitments, preserve relationships
with allies, and be able to counter major threats to national and global security
requires at least some forces in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia―but how much in
each is less clear and, thus, the subject of our discussion of options.
Analysis of Illustrative Postures for Insights on the Trade-offs Among
Strategic Benefits, Risks, and Costs
To understand the consequences of changing the United States’ current overseas posture,
we developed three illustrative postures and applied our qualitative findings and quantitative models to determine how they would affect strategic benefits, risks, and
cost. All of the postures share some foundational elements. Beyond these common
aspects, each posture emphasizes a different goal―cost-reduction, global responsiveness
and engagement, or major contingencies (see Table S.1). These alternative postures
are not meant to be policy options, but rather are analytic tools that enabled us to
evaluate the range of strategic benefits and costs that follow from revising U.S. overseas
military presence. Because each illustrative posture prioritizes a particular objective,
the analyses allow us to estimate the scope and type of effects that pursuing each objective
would have in its purest form.
The illustrative cost-reduction posture (CRP) aims to minimize the cost of the
U.S. global posture while simultaneously maintaining enough forward presence to
achieve national security goals, including enabling global power projection and protecting
the global commons. This posture rests on the notion that closing bases and
bringing forces back to the United States would yield significant cost savings and on
the assumption that the United States could meet its national security objectives with
a smaller overseas presence in selected regions and through new means for maintaining
alliances and pursuing security cooperation. This posture closes/realigns a substantial
portion, but still a minority, of overseas facilities and forces. It represents the minimum
forward military presence that the United States would need to remain a globally
responsive military power.
The global responsiveness and engagement posture (GREP) aims to create an
overseas military presence that maximizes the United States’ ability to rapidly respond
to smaller-scale contingencies and, to increase military burden sharing, to build the military capabilities of allies and partners and their willingness to participate in global
security efforts. U.S. force posture would resemble a regional hub-and-spoke network
in which permanently stationed U.S. forces consolidate at regional hubs (i.e., one or
more primary bases) that can support rotational forces that periodically deploy to the
spokes (i.e., access bases) for operations or exercises. The United States would station a
mixture of forces at each hub to provide a wide range of capabilities for rapid response
and engagement activities.

<a href= "pic01.html">Table S.1 Illustrative Postures</a><br><br>

The illustrative major contingency posture (MCP) positions U.S. forces overseas
so that they would be situated to deter or engage in large-scale operations against specific
potential adversaries: Iran, North Korea, and China. The United States would
place greater forces forward capable of conducting major operations against these
potential adversaries. Conversely, the United States would divest itself of overseas bases
and forces that would not be useful against one of these three adversaries. Consequently,
the United States would retain only those bases in Africa and Europe that
provide critical enabling capabilities for intertheater operations or that could be used
for operations in the Middle East.
The following summarizes the analysis of the postures:
 The CRP is the only illustrative option that would reduce overall costs, illustrating
a rough limit from posture changes of about $3 billion per year in savings,
with a majority coming from Europe, after an initial investment with a 1.5- to
3-year payback. This would come at the expense of reduced levels of security
cooperation activities and potentially assurance of allies.
 The GREP would expand security cooperation opportunities and create the
potential for more robust access to bases for broadly distributed contingencies.
Annual recurring costs would not change, but there would be meaningful transition
costs to realign a small number of forces to provide the recurring savings to
reinvest in rotations in new areas.
 The MCP would provide the highest level of deterrence and assurance of allies and
partners for the three principal state-based security threats of concern. This would
come at the expense of reduced security cooperation in Europe, where assurance
of allies and partners could also decline. The MCP also risks increased exposure
of forward-stationed forces to anti-access threats, and it would add annual recurring
costs as well as require significant investment.
Analysis of the illustrative postures led to several insights. Only by substantially
reducing forces and bases in one or more regions and limiting the level of replacement
by rotations would posture changes yield meaningful savings. This would force one or
more trade-offs in strategic benefits. Conversely, it appears to be infeasible to increase
engagement substantially with new partners while also significantly reducing overall
costs. Realigning forces from one region to the United States to produce operating cost savings to be reinvested elsewhere, whether for rotational or permanent presence,
for operating-cost neutrality is likely to require some investment. Similarly, increasing
presence for specific major threats could require substantial investments. The contrasts
between the CRP and the other two postures suggest that implications for security
cooperation, deterrence, and assurance are likely to be greater than for global responsiveness
and access risk when considering posture options, as long as the options protect
global en route infrastructure, emphasize maintenance of geographically distributed
access to bases, and maintain maritime capabilities.


Posture Options to Consider Depending Upon Strategic Judgments
Europe
Further posture reduction could be considered in Europe, but this could have negative
repercussions for alliance cohesion, assurance of partners, and interoperability. Europe
has long hosted the bulk of U.S. overseas forces, but that presence has been reduced
substantially over the last 20 years. The forces that remain in Europe focus particularly
on security cooperation, so further reductions would limit those activities, with air
bases also enabling direct operational support around the European periphery. Further
reductions could be made as part of overall defense-resource trade-offs to reduce costs
or to meet needs in other regions, but may be detrimental to the NATO alliance.
If substantial reductions were made, limiting continuing presence to the maintenance
of capabilities for global power projection, bases for operations around the
periphery, and forces for formal commitments, the United States could save up to
$2 billion per year. This would diminish security cooperation activities, with impact
greatest in three categories of security cooperation: (1) multinational training capacity,
for example, through the closure of the Joint Multinational Training Command
(JMTC); (2) forces that focus on the strategic and operational level of engagement,
such as headquarters units; and (3) enabling units that build specialized capabilities,
such as logistics, medical, air-ground operations, and intelligence units.
Some of the negative effects of reductions in permanent presence might be mitigated
by using rotational forces and more specialized capabilities (e.g., Special Operations
Forces, missile defense) to replace some of the lost presence. If training with European
allies remains a priority, then JMTC would likely need to be retained. However,
retaining JMTC and achieving the same level of tactically oriented security cooperation
from the United States through rotations would consume about half the potential
savings. Higher, strategic-level engagement could be hindered without keeping major
commands in Europe with high-ranking flag officers and their staffs. This could be
done without high levels of assigned forces, though major force reductions could result
in the loss of U.S.-held senior leadership positions within NATO.

Pacific
In Asia, the United States faces competing demands. The United States aims to deter
North Korea and other major conflicts in Northeast Asia, but the concentration of
U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan keeps those forces under threat from numerous
precision-guided missiles. In the meantime, the United States has an interest in
increasing security engagement with partners in South and Southeast Asia, where the
United States has a much smaller presence consisting of rotational forces.
The majority of the U.S. facilities in South Korea and Japan sit in the heaviest
threat zones and face potential long-range threats from China’s precision-guided
weapons. If the United States wishes to maintain a forward presence at these locations
to deter and assure, there are divergent options that could reduce vulnerabilities to
attack. These facilities could be hardened and protected with missile defenses, or the
number and mix of aircraft and ships could be reduced and restationed elsewhere in
the Pacific―basing availability permitting―or in the United States. Such protections
would not make these bases invulnerable to attack, but they can be valuable if they
take away fairly easy and efficient ways to disable bases and destroy forces.
Through rotational presence in Singapore, the Philippines, and Australia, the
United States is trying to increase the level and sophistication of activities with those
countries and other regional partners. Whether policymakers view this as sufficient
could have implications for the overseas posture. Currently, no partner nations in South
or Southeast Asia have offered access to their territory for the permanent presence of
U.S. forces. Given this reluctance, if greater security cooperation is desired, the Navy
or Marine Corps presence in the region may be the first option, because they do not
rely on significant levels of host-nation hospitality. Alternatively, additional countries
may agree to host rotational presence of U.S. forces to facilitate expanded interactions.
Related to this rotational presence and broader efforts at engagement, the Marine
Corps posture in the Pacific is in transition. In accordance with agreements with Japan
and Australia, the Marine Corps plans to reduce some forces in Okinawa, maintain a
rotational presence in northern Australia, establish a presence in Guam, and increase
forces in Hawaii. However, if Marine Corps forces distributed in the Pacific do not
gain the dedicated lift that would enable them to take advantage of their positioning,
it may be advisable to consider shifting some of them to the continental United States,
given the lower costs there compared with Pacific island locations. For humanitarian
response and security cooperation, the 31st MEU, with a collocated ARG in the
Pacific, provides unique capabilities. The absence of dedicated lift for the other ground
and logistics forces in Okinawa or rotary-wing aviation in other parts of the Pacific
makes their forward position less of an advantage. Depending on how decisionmakers
assess the benefit that additional Marine Corps forces beyond the 31st MEU contribute
by being based in Okinawa or elsewhere in the Pacific with respect to assurance,
security cooperation, or responsiveness, keeping them there merits weighing against
the somewhat higher costs, the potentially limited mobility advantage, the potential threats to Okinawa from China, and the opposition in some quarters in Okinawa to
a continued U.S. presence there. Among these considerations, the biggest is likely to
be how a reduction of forces in the region would affect Japanese and other nations’
perceptions of U.S. commitments to the region. The broader decision to keep these
forces in the Pacific also merits linkage to Navy force structure and positioning considerations
with respect to amphibious ships.
Overall, depending on how decisionmakers judge the likely effect of modest force
reductions in Asia on regional perceptions of the U.S. commitment to the region, how
critical they believe large in-place forces are to deterrence, and the degree to which
forces should be kept in higher-threat zones, modest reductions in the Asia-Pacific
region, including some of the Marine Corps forces and an Air Force base and wing,
could produce some savings―contributing roughly equal amounts of up to $450 million
per year―while preserving in-place forces in South Korea and some additional
capabilities in Japan for broader regional security. This would reflect the call for pursuing
new approaches to defense in the face of resource constraints. Any of these steps,
though, might appear incompatible with the U.S. government’s stated intention to
rebalance toward Asia, even if alternative approaches could provide similar capabilities.
Concerted efforts to explain to allies how security could still be provided would have to
be made, with some risk of not fully assuring key U.S. allies in the region.
Alternatively, emphasizing different aspects of the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance
could lead to increased presence in Asia and the Pacific. If increased security
cooperation in South and Southeast Asia is highly valued and increases in rotational
presence are pursued, this would increase costs. However, if done in combination with
modest reductions in Northeast Asia, costs in the greater region might be held relatively
steady. If such rotations were added while maintaining or increasing presence
oriented toward meeting perceived needs to increase assurance and deterrence, then
annual recurring costs in the region would increase, potentially substantially. Any costs
for hardening of facilities or additional force structure to support rotations would be in
addition to the cost estimates in this report. The region presents a complex set of judgments
and trade-offs regarding assurance, deterrence, security cooperation, and risks,
with a range of options corresponding to different judgments on how different posture
choices are likely to affect these factors.
The Middle East
As a result of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States currently has substantial
forces in the Persian Gulf, but the number and composition of any remaining
forces after the drawdown in Afghanistan remains undetermined. As noted in the
2012 Defense Strategic Guidance, the United States intends to “continue to place a
premium on” presence in the region. In addition to maintaining capabilities to counter
violent extremists and uphold commitments to partner states in the region, the United
States has an interest in preventing Iran from disrupting commerce, seeking to politically pressure or destabilize neighboring states, or developing the capability to threaten
regional states through nuclear coercion.
The United States currently has a network of air bases, significant maritime presence,
and prepositioned equipment in the Persian Gulf region, with plans for groundforce
rotations. U.S. military presence in the region is predominantly rotational, as most
host nations prefer that to permanent presence, and infrastructure to host these rotations
is maintained. Whether further increases to this presence would improve deterrence
and regional stability or would be needed to effectively respond to aggression―
were deterrence to fail―is not clear.
Foreign military presence has long been a sensitive political issue for many Middle
Eastern countries. Hard to gauge are the potential political risks of increasing forces in
the region, the willingness of regional leaders to accept this presence, or problems that
such a sustained, significant presence could pose to partner nations. This could come
from domestic sources, where such presence could spur opposition to the regimes in
the host nations, from other states, or nonstate actors in the region. If a host-nation
government faces the prospect of significant internal unrest, decisionmakers may want
to weigh carefully whether they continue to make investments to military facilities
in that nation. Political instability could well result in diminished or lost American
access, as well as new security concerns. On the other hand, presence could facilitate
improvement in partner capabilities and strengthened relationships, in addition to contributing
to deterrence of potential adversaries and assurance of partners.
Thus, the central posture question in the region is how responsiveness and deterrence
needs in the Persian Gulf should be weighed against the potential for political
tensions and risks. Depending on the weight given to these two competing sets of factors,
decisionmakers could elect to selectively reduce rotations in the region, maintain
the status quo, or seek to increase rotations to the region across the services. To give
some sense of the costs that could be avoided or how they would increase as a result
of these choices, annual armored brigade combat team (ABCT) rotations to Kuwait
would cost roughly $200 million per year, maintaining a composite air expeditionary
wing through continuous rotations costs about $300 million per year, and quarterly
fighter-squadron rotations would be $50C100 million per year, depending on the aircraft
types and how the rotations are executed and not accounting for the possibility of
any needed increases in force structure to provide a sufficient rotation base.

Posture Choices
Tables S.2 and S.3 highlight a few of the major posture choices that emerge from a consideration
of the strategic benefits, risks, and costs of posture changes. They consider
both potential reductions in current posture as well as potential additions. In both cases, the purpose is to highlight how changing concerns and priorities might translate
into potential posture changes.

<a href= "pic02.html">Table S.2 Current Elements of Overseas Posture That Could Be Evaluated for Realignment/Closure</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic03.html">Table S.3 New Elements of Overseas Posture That Could Be Considered</a><br><br>
Significant savings would require choosing from what we find to be a relatively
small set of options. The only substantial ones would be Army and Air Force units and
bases in Europe. Smaller opportunities would be some of the Marine Corps and Air
Force forces in the Pacific and rotational forces in the Middle East. Reductions in Asia
are likely to create more deterrence and assurance risk than reductions in Europe, while
reductions in the Middle East would have mixed effects. Reductions in Europe would
likely affect security cooperation.
Potential increases revolve around three considerations: the value of increasing
security cooperation with new partners to build capacity, posturing to deter and
respond to potential Iranian aggression, and pivoting to Asia for increased deterrence
and assurance of allies. Pursuing the types of options in Table S.3 would increase recurring costs and would involve additional investments in some cases. They could be
pursued independently or in conjunction with some of the reduction options (to reflect
shifting priorities) to reduce the cost impacts.
There are some clear limits to how far consolidation in the United States could
be pursued, beyond which achieving national security goals and executing the 2012
Defense Strategic Guidance would become untenable. There is a minimum threshold
of foreign posture that the United States must retain. Beyond that, there is additional
posture that is almost certainly advisable to retain or even add. But there are a number
of choices in each region for which different judgments could lead to differing calculations
of the advisability of reductions, additions, or changes in the nature of posture.
These posture options for potential consideration represent policy choices that do not
have any one empirical “answer”―only the cost side of the equation can be determined
with some degree of certainty. Instead, decisions will reflect judgments based on the
perceived values assigned to the competing goals―i.e., how they are prioritized―and
the degree to which overseas posture is perceived to advance strategic goals.

The U.S. military posture offers broad scope and geographic reach to contribute to
the nation’s security objectives. It is a physical expression of the enduring global interests
of the United States. The presence of U.S. forces and access to bases in so many
countries provides flexibility to address those security objectives. It allows U.S. forces
to respond quickly to a variety of situations, such as natural disasters and countering
piracy. It allows U.S. forces to train more often with partners and, of course, to fight
the nation’s wars.
The United States not only responds to world events but also seeks to shape them,
and the U.S. military serves as an important instrument in this effort. A forward presence
allows for more opportunities to engage allies and partners, to enhance capabilities
for collective security, and to build coalitions. It also influences the behavior of
those who might disrupt the international order.
These benefits were encapsulated in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review
(QDR) Report, which asserts that U.S. military personnel forward-stationed or rotationally
deployed “help sustain U.S. capacity for global reach and power projection.”1
The QDR Report notes that overseas basing deters adversaries, assures allies and partners,
supports partnership capacity-building efforts, and supports efforts to respond to
contingencies.2
While the U.S. global defense posture provides certain unique advantages, it
comes with associated costs and risks. Maintaining forces overseas or deploying them
temporarily increases costs over stationing and training them within the United States.
The nations who host U.S. forces sometimes restrict their activities, and in some cases
the forward locations are in areas of heightened risks, either because of adversary military
capabilities or greater exposure to violent extremist groups.
The U.S. military has maintained a substantial overseas presence since World
War II. While there has been continuity in the countries that host major U.S. military
facilities, the number and types of forces in those facilities have changed substantially.

Today, the war in Iraq has ended, and a transition of responsibility for security to
Afghan forces has begun. With the end of these conflicts, the national security focus
is shifting to the broader range of challenges that confront the United States. These
changes and U.S. fiscal pressures also create an appropriate point to consider the U.S.
military overseas posture that will serve the interests of the American people in the
coming years. This is clearly recognized in the 2012 DoD Strategic Guidance.
The 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance includes the same posture objectives as the
2010 QDR, while emphasizing the needs to “rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific region,”
continue to “place a premium” on presence in the Middle East, and evolve global posture
in line with the changing security environment―most notably in Europe while
maintaining North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) commitments. “Building
partnership capacity” is emphasized throughout while calling for a rethinking of how
this can be efficiently achieved, such as with rotations and advisory capabilities and
the need to “make thoughtful choices” in light of the strategic shifts and constrained
resources. The 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance seeks to maintain global presence, the
ability to respond globally, and the wherewithal to protect global “freedom of access.”3
Purpose
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81)
directed DoD to commission an independent assessment of the requirements for and
the costs of basing forces outside the United States. DoD asked RAND’s National
Defense Research Institute, a federally funded research and development center, to
carry out the independent analysis. The legislation indicated that the assessment should
include but not be limited to the following five tasks:
1. An assessment of the location and number of United States forces required to be
forward based outside the United States to meet the National Military Strategy,
2010; the QDR; and the engagement strategies and operational plans of the
combatant commands.4
2. An assessment of the following aspects of the defense posture:
a. the current condition and capacity of the available military facilities and
training ranges of the United States overseas for all permanent stations and
deployed locations, including land and improvements at such facilities and
ranges and the availability of additional land, if required, for such facilities
and ranges 

b. the cost of maintaining such infrastructure.
3. A determination of the amounts received by the United States, whether in direct
payments, in-kind contributions, or otherwise, from foreign countries by reason
of military facilities of the United States overseas.
4. A determination of the amounts paid by the United States in direct payments to
foreign countries for the use of facilities, ranges, and lands.
5. An assessment of the advisability of the retention, closure, or realignment of
military facilities of the United States overseas, or of the establishment of new
military facilities of the United States overseas, in light of potential fiscal constraints
on DoD and emerging national security requirements in coming years.
The 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance articulates several goals relevant to posture:
being able to respond to aggression and crises globally, retaining a stabilizing international
presence, protecting a free and open international economic environment, deterring
malevolent actors, and assuring and building the capacity of current and future
partners. However, there are costs to employing an overseas posture to accomplish
these goals, and the guidance emphasizes the need to make judicious choices in an era
of resource constraints. It is valuable to make these costs clear so that the benefits and
costs of overseas posture can be considered within overall defense planning and the
broad set of resource and budget trade-offs.
To accomplish the spectrum of tasks, this report provides an assessment of the
critical underpinning elements of U.S. overseas posture, the benefits it provides, and
what it costs in light of facility conditions, host-nation support, and unique financial
factors. We analyze the strategic benefits, risks, and costs of overseas posture, and we
assess the degree to which different posture alternatives would affect these benefits,
risks, and costs. This informs our assessment of the advisability of changes to U.S.
overseas posture and also enables this report to serve as a decision-support aid for
national security planners and decisionmakers in overseas posture option development
and decisionmaking deliberations.
Approach
To address task 1, we sought to determine the minimum essential elements of posture
required to execute the U.S. national security strategy and meet formal commitments.
In some cases, we identify specific locations and unit types that are fundamental to
meeting the strategy. An example of what we mean by an element of posture is the
global mobility infrastructure that supports deployments and sustainment from the
United States or even from one region to another. Within this element, there may be
some bases that are essential, or there may be others that could be equally valuable
alternatives, as long as a region is sufficiently covered.

Beyond determining the minimum essential needs in general terms with some
key facilities highlighted, three factors preclude a precise, comprehensive, location-bylocation,
unit-by-unit response to task 1. First, as will be discussed in this report, many
of the strategic benefits of overseas posture cannot be definitively measured and quantified,
so it is not possible to define precisely how an individual facility or unit presence
achieves national security goals. There is some band of uncertainty producing a range
of postures that could be considered as fulfilling the intent of the strategy, based on different
judgments regarding the benefits and risks. Second, in some areas, there are multiple
locations and forms of presence that can play similar roles or provide similar benefits
in pursuit of achieving national security goals. Third, the engagement strategies
and operational plans of the combatant commands are based in part on their assigned
forces and other resources available to them. The combatant commands should incorporate
available resources into plans and will naturally do so. However, there may be
other means for accomplishing objectives, and there may be cases where thresholds for
achieving an objective are exceeded, opening room for discussions of rebalancing in
the face of constraints as implied by task 5. Given these factors, the report recognizes
that, beyond what we can clearly identify as needed minimums, other aspects of posture
are likely advisable and cost-effective to maintain or even add―in conjunction
with possibilities for realignment and closure.
Overseas posture provides several strategic benefits that can be valued only qualitatively
through expert judgment, informed by the available theory, evidence, and
experience. These include responsiveness to contingencies, assurance, deterrence, and
the advancement of security cooperation. There are also risks associated with overseas
posture that can hinder its value in achieving these benefits. As a starting point, we
assessed how overseas posture contributes to these strategic goals and what factors generate
associated risks. Then we examined how changes in postures would affect pursuit
of these goals and the risks. The benefits and risks should be weighed against the costs,
with the weights of the strategic benefits dependent upon the judgments of decisionmakers.
To enable this, we developed a detailed, comprehensive cost model to estimate
the cost effects of changes in overseas posture to include unit stationing, facilities, and
rotational presence costs. Other portions of the analysis directly address tasks 2, 3 and
4 to the extent feasible based on available data, with the results supporting the development
and evaluation of posture options.
To inform decisions about “the advisability of the retention, closure, or realignment”
of overseas military facilities called for in task 5, we developed three illustrative
postures that emphasized different goals for overseas posture and costs to help
us understand how possible changes could affect strategic benefits, risks, and costs.
This was intended to develop an understanding of the trade-offs encountered when
considering alternative overseas postures―and on what information and judgments
decisions might turn. The evaluations in the report are intended to serve as decisionsupport
aides, including the results of our cost assessment of each element of overseas posture, found in Appendix B, which can be used as a tool to quickly estimate the cost
effects of posture changes. These results could be used by national security planners to
develop and consider modifications to options not considered in this report or additional
options. They should also help improve intuition about how posture changes
are likely to affect costs, potentially improving the development of options to consider.
To set up and provide a frame of reference for the analysis, the remainder of the
introductory chapter provides a brief history of U.S. global posture and an overview of
current overseas postures.

	<hr><br>
	

The U.S. global defense posture consists of forces rotationally deployed as well as permanently
garrisoned abroad, the facilities and supporting infrastructure that make up
the U.S. military footprint, and the agreements that enable the United States to have
an overseas military presence (e.g., mutual defense treaties, status of forces agreements
[SOFAs], access agreements) (see Figure 1.1). Today, thousands of U.S. troops are stationed
in hundreds of military facilities overseas, conducting activities ranging from
training with partner nations and freedom of navigation operations on the one end to
combat operations on the other. Yet, for much of its history, the United States had few
bases abroad and only a small number of forces permanently stationed overseas, preferring
instead to temporarily dispatch forces from the United States when they were
needed.5 For instance, during the 19th century the United States established a number
of geographically dispersed station squadrons to protect the nation’s commercial interests.
6 While these relatively limited peacetime maritime forces were forward-deployed,
they were not forward-based, and instead relied on store ships anchored in ports, resupply
by ship, and leased civilian facilities (squadron depots) that usually consisted of
little more than a warehouse.7
The U.S. global defense posture has gone through many changes over the past two
centuries. This is hardly surprising, given that the United States has evolved from a
weak, isolated, newly independent nation into a global power with an extensive portfolio
of alliances and security interests around the world. U.S. policymakers have repeatedly
altered the nation’s global defense posture in response to changes in the types of threats they confronted, the development of new military capabilities, and the availability
of overseas bases. 

<a href= "pic04.html">Figure 1.1 U.S. Global Posture</a><br><br>


The United States first established permanent overseas bases after its victory in the
Spanish-American War of 1898.8 As a result of this conflict, the United States acquired
a number of territories in the Far East and the Caribbean, and it constructed military
bases for the defense of some of these possessions and to enable U.S. forces to project
power into these regions. Yet until World War II, domestic public opinion, interservice
disagreements, and the restrictions that the United States agreed to in the Washington
Naval Conference’s Five Power Treaty constrained the size of the peacetime U.S. military
presence overseas.9
This changed as a result of World War II. In particular, the attack on Pearl Harbor
created an enduring sense of American vulnerability that dispelled the past assumption
that the United States would be safe if it remained aloof from world affairs. Consequently,
in 1943 President Franklin Delano Roosevelt first tasked the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) with developing a postwar overseas basing plan. U.S. military planners
concluded that the United States must not allow any country to dominate the Eurasian
continent and that the nation’s armed forces must be kept in a state of readiness,
capable of interdicting threats far beyond America’s borders.10 To carry out this
mission, officials determined that the United States needed to develop a network of
overseas air bases to serve as the nation’s “strategic frontier,” even in a world in which
Washington had good relations with the other great powers.11 The basing plans developed
by the JCS during the 1940s outlined proposals for a network of air bases lying
along the perimeters of the European and Asian continents that would allow Washington
to project power into these areas, while simultaneously precluding their use by
other states.12 Having no particular enemy in mind, the JCS designed these defensive
postures so the United States would be positioned to respond to threats wherever they
might emerge.13
The United States did not begin to develop plans for a global posture directed
against the USSR until 1947.14 At that time, U.S. officials realized that few of their
desired bases were close enough to the Soviet Union to support offensive strikes, given
the limited range of U.S. bombers. Consequently, they began to seek airfields along
the USSR’s southern rim and in the United Kingdom (UK). While basing proposals of
the late 1940s focused on countering a particular enemy, the Soviet Union, they maintained
the core feature of those of the early 1940s: an outlying ring of air bases that
encircled the Eurasian continent.
Despite the increased tension with the Soviet Union, U.S. officials were unable
to implement fully any of the basing plans that the JCS proposed between 1943 and
1949. It was not until after the outbreak of the Korean War that the United States
was able to secure extensive basing rights from other countries and permanently station
large numbers of forces abroad.15 But the resulting presence differed considerably
from the postures the JCS had envisioned in the 1940s. Throughout the Cold War,
the United States sought to contain the Soviet Union by positioning large numbers of
U.S. ground, air, and naval forces in garrisons at strategic strongpoints in Europe and Asia (see Figure 1.2). For example, at one point the Army had five divisions based in
Europe, while the U.S. Air Force (USAF) had as many as 2,100 aircraft stationed at
over 40 bases in Europe.16
After the end of the Cold War and the disappearance of the Soviet threat, Presidents
George H. W. Bush and William J. Clinton responded to the new and more
benign security environment by shrinking the size of the U.S. military and the proportion
of troops stationed abroad. The most significant overseas reductions were made to
the U.S. presence in Europe. For instance, in 1989, U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR)
consisted of 213,000 soldiers stationed at 41 large garrisons, which were made up of
850 individual installations (primarily in Germany).17 By 1994, there were only 75,315
soldiers in USAREUR and the Army had returned 564 installations to Germany (see
Figure 1.3).18 Similarly, in 1990, U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) contained 800
aircraft, 72,000 active duty personnel, three numbered air forces, and 27 bases. By
1996, however, postCCold War reductions left only 240 aircraft, 33,000 active duty
airmen, two numbered air forces, and six bases with active flying missions.19 Nevertheless, both administrations concluded that the United States needed to maintain a
significant forward presence to deter aggression and preserve regional stability. Since it
was unclear where contingencies might arise, however, the residual garrison Cold War
force was reoriented toward expeditionary missions so that it could deploy wherever it
might be needed.

<a href= "pic05.html">Figure 1.2 Active Duty U.S. Military Personnel Overseas, 1953C2010</a><br><br>

At the same time that the United States was drawing down its posture in Europe,
the Gulf War and the subsequent enforcement of no-fly zones over Iraq precipitated
a U.S. military buildup in the Middle East. Yet, Middle Eastern political sensitivities
forced the United States to try to develop a less visible military presence by temporarily
rotating units to host-nation facilities instead of permanently deploying them to large
American bases. Therefore, in U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), the United
States emphasized maritime forces, prepositioned equipment, and contingency access
to partner facilities for ground and air forces. As result, in 1995 the U.S. Navy (USN)
reactivated the Fifth Fleet and stationed its headquarters at Manama, Bahrain. Additionally,
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Qatar provided
the United States with access to bases and stored prepositioned equipment.20

<a href= "pic06.html">Figure 1.3 USAREUR Army Installations Returned to Germany, 1987C1996</a><br><br>


The U.S. global posture continued to evolve after the postCCold War contraction
and the expansion into the Middle East. Notably, the George W. Bush administration
initiated a Global Defense Posture Review (GDPR) in an effort to make the
U.S. overseas military presence more agile and expeditionary. The Bush administration
felt that the existing U.S. posture was too static, and therefore not suited to deal
with the evolving security environment that was characterized by uncertainty and the
proliferation of asymmetric threats (such as terrorism, anti-access area denial strategies,
weapons of mass destruction [WMD] proliferation, and insurgency).21 Additionally,
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld wanted to position U.S. forces only where they
were wanted. To reduce friction with local communities, Rumsfeld sought to relocate
the United States’ most controversial bases away from heavily populated areas and
emphasized smaller-footprint facilities that would be less likely to generate host-nation
opposition.22
The 2004 GDPR proposed a number of changes to achieve the administration’s
objectives (Figure 1.4).23 First, it sought to reduce the U.S. military’s dependence on
main operating bases (MOBs) in favor of access to facilities called forward operating
sites (FOSs) and cooperative security locations (CSLs) that had little to no permanent
U.S. military presence but to which troops could deploy when needed. To implement
these changes, the GDPR intended to reduce and consolidate the existing U.S. overseas
military presence in Western Europe and Northeast Asia, which was seen as less useful
for dealing with future security challenges.24
The GDPR also sought to enhance U.S. operational flexibility by dispersing the
U.S. military presence across additional FOSs and CSLs that were proximate to the
“arc of instability” stretching from the Middle East, through South Asia, and into the
Asia-Pacific region. In U.S. European Command (EUCOM), the Bush administration sought to shift the balance of the U.S. military presence to the southeast by expanding
security cooperation with Bulgaria and Romania through the creation of Joint
Task Force East. In Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, the United States sought to
expand its “presence without permanence” by developing a network of FOSs and CSLs
that would be used to prosecute the Global War on Terrorism and for contingency
purposes.25

<a href= "pic07.html">Figure 1.4 2004 GDPR Changes to U.S. Force Deployments</a><br><br>
The effort to adapt the U.S. global posture to changing circumstances did not end
with the Bush administration. Instead, many of the reforms initiated under the GDPR
are still in the process of being implemented, while others have been modified by the Barack H. Obama administration.26 Moreover, in 2009 the Obama administration
began a new posture review “to determine how to make it more strategically sound,
operationally resilient, and politically sustainable.”27 This process concluded that the
United States must maintain a posture of “sustained forward engagement,” but that
because of declining budgets it had to identify which regions were a priority and allocate
U.S. forces and resources accordingly.28 The Defense Strategic Guidance released
by DoD in January 2012 clearly stated that the United States’ primary concern was
the Asia-Pacific theater, and that it would, therefore, rebalance its forces toward this
region. At the same time, DoD stressed that the United States would retain a considerable
military presence in the Middle East to ensure stability in the Persian Gulf and
to support Israel. By contrast, while the United States remains prepared to uphold its
Article 5 commitments to its NATO allies, the U.S. military presence in the region is
expected to “evolve.” This rebalancing, therefore, entails DoD efforts to acquire access
to new military facilities in the Western Pacific. It may also involve divesting some
legacy locations that have lessened in importance, especially considering resource constraints
and the resulting need to choose judiciously, a common refrain in the strategic
guidance. At the same time, the strategic guidance maintains that U.S. forces must be
ready and able to defeat aggressors anywhere in the world.29

The Obama administration has undertaken a number of specific initiatives to
modify the U.S. posture and implement its policy of forward engagement. A key part
of this policy has involved refocusing the United States from the conflicts in Iraq and
Afghanistan toward the Asia-Pacific region. With the end of operations of Iraq, the
United States withdrew its forces at the end of 2011 and did not secure access rights
to bases in Iraq. The Obama administration has also announced that it will remove
combat forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2014 and it will continue to discuss
access to Afghanistan bases as a part of a bilateral agreement.30 Nevertheless, the United States intends to keep a significant number of forces in the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, and
Bahrain, including plans to station up to eight littoral combat ships (LCSs) at Manama.31
In addition, President Obama has renewed the United States’ commitment to
Europe and NATO with the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) to missile
defense, while simultaneously reducing the size of the U.S. conventional forces based
in Western Europe. To provide allies with protection from ballistic missiles launched
by rogue states such as Iran, the EPAA calls for stationing four ballistic missile defense
(BMD) destroyers at Rota, Spain, as well as radar sites and Aegis Ashore BMD interceptors
in key countries.32
By contrast, in Western Europe DoD is reducing its military presence, especially
in Germany, by withdrawing one A-10 squadron and deactivating an air control squadron.
The Army is in the process of even more significant reductions to its presence in
Germany, which include deactivating the 170th and 172nd brigades in addition to
removing approximately 2,500 soldiers from support units and activities. Moreover,
once the V Corps headquarters completes its deployment to Afghanistan, it will not
return to Germany. As a result of these personnel changes, USAREUR will also close
garrisons at Bamberg, Schweinfurt, and Heidelberg, so that by 2015 there will be only
approximately 30,000 soldiers at seven major bases in Europe (see Figure 1.5). In an
effort to compensate for the diminished Army presence, the United States has committed
a heavy BCT to the NATO Response Force and will rotate a battalion-sized task
force from this unit to Europe for multinational training exercises.33
While the U.S. posture in Europe is diminishing, the Obama administration is
seeking to expand the U.S. presence in Asia by shifting capabilities that are no longer
needed in the Middle East as combat operations end there.34 In November 2011, the
United States and Australian governments reached an agreement to rotate as many
as 2,500 marines to northern Australia for joint training and exercises, in addition to
increasing the frequency of USAF aircraft rotational deployments, including bombers,
to Australian airfields.35
U.S. forces in Japan are in the process of implementing a realignment agreement
that was reached by the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee in 2006. It
included transforming Camp Zama and Yokota Air Base joint facilities that are shared with the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, moving a carrier air wing to expanded facilities
at MCAS Iwakuni, reducing the U.S. presence on Okinawa south of Kadena Air Base,
and relocating 8,000 marines from the III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and
their dependents to Guam.36 

<a href= "pic08.html">Figure 1.5 PostCCold War USAREUR Transformation</a><br><br>

While many of these initiatives have proceeded relatively smoothly, the realignment
of the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) presence on Okinawa has encountered some
delays, leading the government of Japan and the United States to announce revisions to
the 2006 plan in an April 2012 joint statement. In particular, they decided to decouple
the relocation of USMC personnel from Okinawa to Guam and the attendant land
returns south of Kadena Air Base from the move of MCAS Futenma to the Futenma
Replacement Facility. Under the new plan, 9,000 marines and their dependents are
going to move from Okinawa to locations outside of Japan, including Guam, where the
authorized strength will be about 5,000 marines. The USMC units remaining on Okinawa
will include the III MEF Headquarters, the First Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW)
Headquarters, the Third Marine Logistics Group Headquarters, the 31st Marine Expeditionary
Unit (MEU), and base support units, as well as critical aviation, ground, and
support units.37 The movement of USMC units to Guam will “occur when appropriate
facilities are available to receive them.”38 In addition, Japan and the United States will
consider cooperating to develop joint training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth
of the Northern Marianas Islands. The United States is also establishing a rotational
USMC presence in Australia (discussed above) and increasing the USMC presence in
Hawaii. In total, therefore, the United States intends to keep four deployable MEUsized
marine air-ground task forces (MAGTFs) in U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM).39
See Figure 1.6 for the planned USMC laydown in PACOM.
While Japan and the United States affirmed their intention to relocate MCAS
Futenma to the Camp Schwab Henoko-saki area in their April 2012 joint statement,40
there are a number of obstacles―including opposition in the U.S. Congress and on Okinawa―that may prevent this plan from being implemented. Some members
of Congress have opposed the proposed realignment because of its cost and the
uncertainty surrounding its execution, resulting in congressional refusal to fund the
Obama administration’s request for military construction (MILCON) funding in the
FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act until a number of specific conditions
are met.41 Moreover, because the move to Henoko involves offshore landfill construction
of an airfield, implementation cannot begin before securing a landfill permit from local officials, including the governor of Okinawa, Hirokazu Nakaima. As Okinawan
public opposition toward the move to Henoko has grown, Nakaima and other major
Okinawan political figures have voiced increased concerns about the relocation to
Henoko.42

<a href= "pic09.html">Figure 1.7 U.S. Global Defense Posture: Expansion by Era</a><br><br>


A potentially important part of the U.S. buildup includes committing 60 percent
of the USN’s ships to the Pacific by 2020, depending on the composition of the
ships assigned to the theater. As a part of this, the USN is in the process of rotationally
deploying up to four LCSs at Changi Naval Base in Singapore, with the first ship
expected to deploy in 2013.43 DoD is also seeking to expand U.S. access to partner
facilities in Southeast Asia.


In sum, U.S. global posture is continuously evolving. While the facilities typically
are made up of a collection of commitments from different eras, the size and composition
of the forces change (see Figure 1.2). U.S. bases and forces in Western Europe and
Northeast Asia are a legacy of past conflicts that have been repurposed to deal with
new security challenges. Similarly, the U.S. military footprint in CENTCOM was
established during more than a decade of enforcing sanctions against Iraq after the first
Gulf War, but now these bases and forces are focused on deterring Iranian aggression
and combating violent extremism. Furthermore, in the past decade, the United States
has established a new, lighter-footprint type of presence to fulfill new commitments
that it has made in Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Southeast and Central
Asia. Now changes are being made in Asia as global security priorities change.
These changes may not be the last in the postCGlobal War on Terrorism, post-
Iraq, and post-Afghanistan era. The shaping of the pivot to Asia appears to be continuing,
and the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance calls for evolution and innovation in
overseas posture. It sets forth significant guidance for posture planning as indicated by
these statements drawn from the guidance:
It [the Joint Force] will have global presence emphasizing the Asia-Pacific and the
Middle East while still ensuring our ability to maintain our defense commitments
to Europe, and strengthening alliances and partnerships across all regions.
It [the Joint Force] will preserve our ability to conduct the missions we judge most
important to protecting core national interests: … deterring and defeating aggression
by adversaries, including those seeking to deny our power projection.
The Joint Force will be prepared to confront and defeat aggression anywhere in
the world.
Accordingly, while the U.S. military will continue to contribute to security globally,
we will of necessity rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific region. Our relationships
with Asian allies and key partners are critical to the future stability and growth of
the region. We will emphasize our existing alliances, which provide a vital foundation
for Asia-Pacific security. We will also expand our networks of cooperation
with emerging partners throughout the Asia-Pacific to ensure collective capability
and capacity for securing common interests.… The maintenance of peace, stability,
the free flow of commerce, and of U.S. influence in this dynamic region will
depend in part on an underlying balance of military capability and presence.
Our defense efforts in the Middle East will be aimed at countering violent extremists
and destabilizing threats, as well as upholding our commitment to allies and
partner states. Of particular concern are the proliferation of ballistic missiles and
weapons of mass destruction (WMD).… To support these objectives, the United States will continue to place a premium on U.S. and allied military presence in C and
support of C partner nations in and around this region.
Most European countries are now producers of security rather than consumers
of it. Combined with the drawdown in Iraq and Afghanistan, this has created
a strategic opportunity to rebalance the U.S. military investment in Europe,
moving from a focus on current conflicts toward a focus on future capabilities.
In keeping with this evolving strategic landscape, our posture in Europe must
also evolve. As this occurs, the United States will maintain our Article 5 commitments
to allied security and promote enhanced capacity and interoperability
for coalition operations. In this resource-constrained era, we will also work with
NATO allies to develop a “Smart Defense” approach to pool, share, and specialize
capabilities as needed to meet 21st century challenges.
Building partnership capacity elsewhere in the world also remains important
for sharing the costs and responsibilities of global leadership.… Whenever
possible, we will develop innovative, low-cost, and small-footprint approaches to
achieve our security objectives, relying on exercises, rotational presence, and advisory
capabilities.
To enable economic growth and commerce, America, working in conjunction
with allies and partners around the world, will seek to protect freedom of access
throughout the global commonsC those areas beyond national jurisdiction that
constitute the vital connective tissue of the international system.
Provide a Stabilizing Presence. U.S. forces will conduct a sustainable pace of
presence operations abroad, including rotational deployments and bilateral and
multilateral training exercises. These activities reinforce deterrence, help to build
the capacity and competence of U.S., allied, and partner forces for internal and
external defense, strengthen alliance cohesion, and increase U.S. influence. A
reduction in resources will require innovative and creative solutions to maintain
our support for allied and partner interoperability and building partner
capacity. However, with reduced resources, thoughtful choices will need to be made
regarding the location and frequency of these operations.
…it will be necessary to examine how this strategy will influence existing campaign
and contingency plans so that more limited resources may be better tuned to
their requirements. This will include a renewed emphasis on the need for a globally
networked approach to deterrence and warfare.44
We conduct our analysis of posture requirements and the advisability of changes
through the lens of these statements.

	<b><a name="T7">The Current U.S. Global Posture</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	


In 2012, the bulk of the U.S. overseas military presence is located in EUCOM,
CENTCOM, and PACOM, with fewer forces stationed in U.S. Africa Command
(AFRICOM) and U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). See Table 1.1 for the
current levels of assigned U.S. forces in each theater.
European Command
In EUCOM, there are permanent U.S. garrisons in Germany, Belgium, the UK, Italy,
Spain, Greece, Turkey, and Portugal, as well as smaller facilities in Hungary, Romania,
Poland, Bulgaria, and Norway. In short, the United States has nearly 80,000 activeduty
personnel stationed at 39 bases in 15 countries in EUCOM. Figure 1.8 shows
a map of major EUCOM installations, while Table 1.2 shows the number of major
U.S. military installations in EUCOM, by type, for each service, corresponding to the
installation locations shown in Figure 1.8.

<a href= "pic10.html">Table 1.1 U.S. Military Personnel Assignments, by Combatant Command</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic11.html">Figure 1.8 Location of U.S. Military Installations in the EUCOM Area of Responsibility</a><br><br>

After the planned inactivation of the Army units, USAREUR’s combat forces
will consist of an airborne BCT located in Italy, as well as a combat aviation brigade,
a Stryker cavalry regiment, and a Special Forces (SF) battalion stationed in Germany.
Additionally, the Army will retain five enabling brigades in Europe, its training facilities
at Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels, the hospital at Landstuhl, and the Army Air and
Missile Defense Command (AAMDC) at Kaiserslautern. For its part, the USAF currently
has only the Third Air Force headquarters, one airlift wing, and one fighter
squadron in Germany; one aerial refueling wing, three fighter squadrons, and one
special operations group in the UK; and two fighter squadrons in Italy. The USAF
also has air base squadrons at Lajes Air Base in the Azores and at Incirlik Air Base in
Turkey. The USN maintains the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean with bases in Italy,
Spain, and Greece. In contrast to the other services, the USMC presence in Europe is
quite small.
Central Command
In CENTCOM, the U.S. military presence largely consists of forces temporarily
deployed to partner bases. Figure 1.9 depicts the locations of U.S. installations in
CENTCOM’s area of responsibility (AOR), while Table 1.3 lists a summary of U.S. installations and forces in the theater. The column for the number of personnel is blank
because these are rotational forces, not permanently assigned. For example, in Kuwait,
the Army and the USAF have units at Camp Buehring and Camp Arifjan and Ali
Al Salem Air Base, respectively.45 Qatar also currently hosts U.S. military personnel, mainly soldiers and airmen, at Camp As Sayliyah and Al Udeid Air Base.46 Camp As
Sayliyah is a large Army staging area that also contains prepositioned equipment, while
Al Udeid houses CENTCOM’s combined air and space operations center (CAOC)
and hosts an air expeditionary wing (AEW). Additionally, the UAE hosts U.S. military
personnel, primarily at Al Dhafra Air Base, although there are also Army Patriot missile
batteries in the UAE and the USN has access to and frequently visits UAE ports.47
The USN permanent presence in the Persian Gulf, however, is concentrated at the
Fifth Fleet headquarters in Manama, Bahrain, which hosts approximately 6,000 military
personnel and civilian DoD employees.48 Saudi Arabia has not hosted a large U.S.
military presence since 2003, yet today there remains a small number of U.S. military
personnel and contractors who work with the Saudi Ministry of Defense, Ministry of
Interior, and Saudi Arabian National Guard to build their capabilities.49 Finally, the
USAF has contingency access to a number of airfields in Oman.
Today, one of the largest concentrations of U.S. forces overseas is in Central Asia
for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). As of December 3, 2012, there were 68,000
U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan.50 Most of this presence, however, is temporary,
as the Obama administration has announced its intention to remove combat forces by
the end of 2014 and is still discussing post-2014 basing rights with the Afghan government.
The status of the USAF’s large mobility and refueling hub at Manas Air Base
in Kyrgyzstan remains uncertain. While the Kyrgyz government has indicated that
it wants U.S. forces to leave, thenCSecretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that the
United States will reevaluate its interest in the base after 2014.51

<a href= "pic14.html">Table 1.3 Major U.S. Military Installations and Units in CENTCOM Area of Responsibility</a><br><br>


Pacific Command
The PACOM AOR contains nearly 154,000 active-duty personnel stationed at 49
major bases in eight countries (excluding the United States). Figure 1.10 depicts the
locations of these facilities. In PACOM, the U.S. primary overseas bases and permanent
overseas presence are concentrated in Northeast Asia. Nevertheless, as discussed
above, the United States has been expanding its access to partner facilities in Southeast
Asia and Oceania. Since 2002, the United States has maintained a rotational presence
on the Philippine islands as a part of OEF-Philippines. Today, however, U.S. forces
have secured additional rights to regularly use major air and naval bases in the Philippines as well as to make occasional port calls in Vietnam. For many years, the USAF
has also used U-Tapao Air Base in Thailand as a contingency mobility location. Finally,
Australia has agreed to host more frequent rotational American forces, including up to
2,500 marines at Darwin.

<a href= "pic15.html">Figure 1.10 Location of Major U.S. Military Installations in PACOM Area of Responsibility</a><br><br>


Some of the American forces in the Western Pacific are also stationed on U.S.
territory, most notably Guam, Hawaii, and Alaska.52 Andersen Air Force Base on
Guam hosts the 36th Wing, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as well as rotational
bombers and tankers. Naval Base Guam supports permanently stationed nuclear
attack submarines (SSNs).
An additional significant piece of the U.S. posture in PACOM is the atoll of
Diego Garcia, which lies on the interstices of the combatant commands (COCOMs) in the Indian Ocean and therefore is also a part of CENTCOM. Diego Garcia contains
a safe harbor and onshore facilities that provide critical support to USN units
in the region and also a large airfield that is used by USAF mobility aircraft and as a
bomber forward operating location. One-third of the U.S. afloat prepositioned ships
are stationed at Diego Garcia, and the base serves as a critical communications node
and satellite tracking station.53

The Republic of Korea currently hosts 28,500 U.S. military personnel, primarily
soldiers and airmen. Figure 1.11 depicts the location of these installations, and
Table 1.4 shows a summary of the forces and major installations in Korea. The Army
combat forces include an armored BCT (ABCT), a combat aviation brigade, and a fires
brigade, while the USAF has four fighter squadrons at Osan and Kunsan Air Bases. In
addition, the USN has a small supporting unit at Chinhae, and the USMC periodically
rotates forces for exercises to Camp Mujuk. U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) are presently undergoing a significant realignment, moving most of the Army units that had
been stationed near the demilitarized zone or in Seoul since 1953 to two southern hubs
at Camp Humphreys and Daegu.54 Because this process requires significant construction,
especially at Camp Humphreys, this consolidation is proceeding slowly.
U.S. Forces, Japan, are also in the midst of a transition. Today, there are around
35,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan, with nearly half of those based on
the island of Okinawa. Figure 1.12 depicts the location of these facilities, and Table 1.5
lists the major bases in Japan. The largest components of the U.S. presence on the main
Japanese islands consists of the Seventh Fleet, including the aircraft carrier the USS
George Washington, homeported at Yokosuka; an amphibious squadron at Sasebo; and
Carrier Air Wing 5 at Naval Air Facility Atsugi, which is moving to Iwakuni, where
it will join a marine aircraft group; a USAF fighter wing at Misawa Air Base and an
airlift wing at Yokota Air Base; and U.S. Army Japan/I Corps forward headquarters at
Camp Zama. On Okinawa, the III MEF and many of its units are stationed at Marine
Corps Base Butler and MCAS Futenma, and a USAF wing is at Kadena Air Base.55

Africa Command
The United States has a very limited military presence in AFRICOM, mainly consisting
of expansible and access facilities. Figure 1.13 depicts the locations of U.S. military
installations in AFRICOM, while Table 1.6 shows a summary of the forces and
installations in AFRICOM. The AFRICOM AOR contains less than 300 active duty
permanently assigned personnel at ten bases in ten different countries.
In AFRICOM, the only permanent U.S. military presence on the continent is
at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, which hosts approximately 2,100 steady-state personnel
and up to an additional 2,000 surge personnel that support Combine Joint
Task Force Horn of Africa (CJTFCHOA), CENTCOM, AFRICOM, and U.S. Special
Operations Command. Ascension Island is a key U.S. Transportation Command
(TRANSCOM) location, while U.S. forces also have access to facilities in Ethiopia, the
Seychelles, South Sudan, Senegal, Uganda, Burkina Faso, and Kenya.

Southern Command
In SOUTHCOM, the United States has only a small military presence, which is
focused on counternarcotics, counterterrorism, and humanitarian assistance/disaster
response operations, in addition to building local partner capacity. This presence
includes access to airfields in Aruba-Curacao, Colombia, and El Salvador. USAF has
a satellite tracking station in Antigua. The Army also leads Joint Task ForceCBravo at Soto Cano Airbase in Honduras. Finally, the USN retains access to Guantanamo
Bay, which is home to Joint Task Force GTMO, which operates the military detention
facility.

Maritime Presence
In addition to protecting freedom of passage on the world’s shipping lanes, the maritime
presence of the USN and USMC provides flexibility to provide presence where
presence needs may be temporary, presence needs may be temporarily higher, or land
bases are not available. Additionally, USN and shipboard USMC forces provide agility
to the U.S. regional presence through built-in mobility, which makes the maritime
posture fundamentally different from that of the Army and Air Force. For maritime
posture, it is less relevant where the maritime forces are homeported, but rather the
amount of forward presence that naval vessels are able to maintain on a regular basis.
This difference extends to the Marine Corps to the extent that it relies on amphibious
ships in sustaining Marine Corps overseas presence or agility when forward deployed
through MEU/Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) teams.

The Navy has a forward-deployed presence goal of having on average 2.7 carrier
strike groups (CSGs) deployed at any time. It also has presence goals for its submarine
fleet and the other surface combatant vessels, along with MEU/ARG presence in conjunction
with the Marine Corps. The number of ships that are available for forward
presence at any one time is primarily determined by the number of ships in the fleet,
in conjunction with operating policies and maintenance needs. A naval vessel spends a
substantial amount of its commissioned life in maintenance. Scheduling maintenance
to meet operational needs, preserve ship life, execute life-cycle maintenance efficiently,
and maintain stability and efficiency in the naval shipyards that keep the ships operating
is a major consideration in supporting presence goals for the Navy. So too is maintaining
a reasonable quality of life for a vessel’s personnel. For a given set of personnel
policies that govern how long and frequently sailors can be away from home and a given set of maintenance policies, along with transit time from homeports, one can
directly translate naval force structure into a level of presence potential.
Most CONUS-based ships are operated on 27C32 month fleet response plan
(FRP) cycles built around periodic extended depot maintenance phases56 in which
major shipyard or depot-level repairs and upgrade and modernization work is performed.
During these maintenance periods, a ship is unavailable for tasking for deployment
or training. Upon completion of maintenance, the crew must then go through
basic unit-level and integrated training phases to be certified for major combat operations
(MCOs) and thus available for deployment and employment for the full spectrum
of missions.57 From this point until the start of the next maintenance phase, ships are
available for deployed operations. As with all of the services, the Navy has personnel
tempo (PERSTEMPO) goals to protect the quality of life of personnel and to preserve
the effectiveness of the all-volunteer force. The Navy’s policies call for at least 50 percent
of sailors’ time in homeport during each FRP cycle, and the time at home between
deployments should be at least as long as the previous deployment length, which puts
a limit on steady-state overseas presence during the time available for deployment (the
ship and crew are available throughout this period for surges to emergent contingency
response needs).58 Thus, the limit on steady-state presence for ships under these policies
is a function of the number of ships in the fleet, the length of maintenance cycles
for a given class of ships, and operational funding to keep the ships underway and to
sustain training.
To support rotational or surge deployments, the Navy maintains overseas naval
stations, support activities, bases, and support facilities for resupply and maintenance
and command and control, along with access to ports of call. Examples include Naval
Support Activities in Italy and Bahrain, Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia, and
Naval Base Guam. These facilities support fleet operations and thus “presence.”
The Navy also forward stations some forces in homeports overseas to increase
naval presence in a region when critical long-term needs exceed the supply of presence
that can be provided through FRP cycles. These forward-stationed forces are designated
Forward Deployed Naval Forces (FDNF). Beyond increasing presence by eliminating transit time, FDNF ships and crews operate with different policies that enable
continuous availability for employment in the homeported region (either deployed at
sea or from a port where continuous maintenance and training policies enable response
within 30 days), increasing the amount of presence achieved for a given level of force
structure. Instead of operating with FRP cycles, the ships do not enter into extended
depot maintenance periods that require a training stand-down, but rather undergo
depot-level maintenance through more frequent, shorter maintenance events,59 which
keep them ready for relatively short-notice taskings, with this mirrored by the crews,
which stay trained and ready. Ships generally are kept in theater for ten years before
being “hull-swapped” with similar ships, at which point they enter a shipyard for more
extended maintenance, to possibly include deferred “deep” maintenance. Additionally,
crews are able to maintain up to 100 percent presence in the homeported region
because they can provide trained and ready overseas presence without being at sea away
from their homeport, removing the impact of PERSTEMPO limits on presence. In
effect, to gain the full presence potential of FDNF, the Navy employs different maintenance,
training, and PERSTEMPO policies.
FDNF improves the Navy’s ability to keep forces on station in specific areas,
thereby increasing ability to engage, provide deterrence, and be responsive during contingencies.
However, having forces in the FDNF also does not guarantee constant
working presence or continuous readiness for all missions. FDNF ships still need
maintenance, and crews cannot be ready at all times for all missions, particularly complex
ones. In addition, total maintenance needs can be affected by the high operating
tempo and deferment of some depot maintenance activities, such as structural preservation
tasks. The lack of an FRP cycle with periodic stand-downs requires more intensive
PERSTEMPO management of crews and affects long-term PERSTEMPO.
The Navy could try to increase forward presence by extending FDNF maintenance
and training cycle policies to the total force. However, given PERSTEMPO
limits and transit time effects, the forward presence increase would remain somewhat
limited. To overcome this limit, the number of FDNF ships could be increased. However,
the lack of stand-down periods and continuous readiness would begin affecting
the PERSTEMPO of a larger portion of personnel, with unclear effects on recruiting
and retention. Either way, it would fundamentally change the Navy’s maintenance paradigm
with unclear effects, likely including increased operating costs and potentially
shorter ship life cycles, as they would not be able to rotate off of the high FDNF-like
operating tempo. Such changes could drive imbalances in shipyards and other maintenance
providers that would drive inefficiencies. If either of these two directions were
to be considered―broadly applying FDNF policies or increasing the size of FDNF―a
more in-depth examination of the broader impacts on ship life, personnel, maintenance,
and total costs would need to be undertaken. We considered this beyond the scope of this study. In another FDNF alternative, crews could be flown into an overseas
port in a crew-swap paradigm without formally homeporting the ship and assigning
the personnel overseas. This would eliminate the loss in presence from sailing to and
from the United States and would eliminate the impact of the dwell limit, but it would
require increased personnel in the force. Given the unknown impacts of broad changes
in maintenance, training, and personnel policies, combined with the study’s assumption
of force structure neutrality, we limit changes in naval force structure considered
in this report to those achievable through very modest changes in FDNF.
In summary, the Navy primarily provides forward presence through rotational
forces based in the United States. These forces go through maintenance periods, train,
and are certified both as individual deploying units and as strike groups and then
deploy, with the typical deployment running to 6C7 months. The biggest factors influencing
availability for presence are the size of the fleet and the policies for maintenance,
training and readiness, and PERSTEMPO. Although forward stationing of assets can
improve availability to an extent, naval presence is more influenced by the size of the
fleet than the level of overseas basing.
It should also be noted that were other services, particularly the Army and the
Air Force, to switch from an emphasis on permanent basing to one focused primarily
on rotational deployments to achieve overseas presence (all services currently use
some combination of the two), they would ultimately hit the same limits, with forcestructure
size becoming the determinant of presence limits. This is reflected in steadystate
deployment limits recognized through applications of PERSTEMPO limits with
the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model and the Air Force’s Air and Space
Expeditionary Force Construct. It was also reflected in the personnel stress on the force
that occurred at the peak of OIF and OEF, when dwell-to-deployment ratios did not
always meet goals for the force.
How This Report Is Organized
This report has three main parts, each with a different focus. The first part describes the
strategic benefits and considerations that should be taken into account when making
decisions about overseas posture, along with the risks that might jeopardize those benefits.
The second part deals with the relative costs of overseas posture, and the third
part describes and assesses illustrative postures with respect to the strategic considerations
and how they would affect costs.
Chapters Two, Three, and Four take up the issues of strategic benefits, with
Chapter Two describing how U.S. forces deploy to contingencies, the role of posture
in those deployments, and the role of overseas basing in enabling direct operational
execution. Chapter Three considers assurance and deterrence. Chapter Four discusses the relationship between security cooperation and basing. Chapter Five describes the
risks to those benefits.
The chapters of the report that deal with cost issues are Chapters Six, Seven, and
Eight. Chapter Six discusses the current condition of overseas installations and how
this compares with U.S. installations. These costs would include any need either to
modernize an installation or its restore facilities and capabilities. Chapter Seven examines
the host-nation support that DoD receives when it stations forces in a foreign
country. Chapter Eight describes our approach to building a cost model that enables us
to determine the incremental costs beyond U.S. stationing and maintaining overseas
bases and forces, as well the difference in permanent and rotational presence options.
Chapter Nine describes three illustrative postures as a way of illustrating the
issues that policymakers must consider as it contemplates structural change driven by
the influences described above. Chapter Ten assesses the postures, describing how they
affect strategic benefits, risks, and costs. Finally, Chapter Eleven presents the study’s
conclusions. The report also has nine appendixes with additional analysis details and
information. Two related appendixes, not available to the general public, were distributed
separately, one dealing with mobility and another with EUCOM operational
plans.
