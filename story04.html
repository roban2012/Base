	<hr><br>
	
This chapter responds to the NDAA requirement to determine both direct payments
and other contributions from host nations supporting U.S. military facilities overseas
and direct payments by the United States to host nations for use of facilities, ranges,
and lands. It puts these contributions and payments in the context of posture analysis
by reporting on the ways in which they can affect the relative costs of maintaining an
overseas presence and discussing how to factor them into analyses of alternative postures.
Flows can occur bilaterally, as in the case of host-nation support (HNS) and U.S.
payments to the governments of host nations, or multilaterally, as in the case of the
NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).
To assess the magnitude and fiscal implications of HNS and U.S. payments to
other nations, we looked at 12 countries (Germany, South Korea, Japan, Italy, the
UK, Australia, Bahrain, Turkey, Spain, Qatar, Kuwait, and Djibouti) that could be
expected to provide the United States with HNS or, conversely, receive U.S. payments.
Together, the 12 countries account for a large majority of the United States’ overseas
military presence.
We found that the data are scant and scattered for many of those countries, but
sufficient to draw a few general conclusions relevant to posture decisions. For example,
a close examination of historical and contemporary records suggests that HNS―in
various forms―offsets a substantial share of U.S. overseas basing costs in a number of
venues, even if sizable amounts of U.S.-borne costs remain. In the case of Japan, the
country for which we have the most comprehensive data, we identified annual support
potentially within range of $6.5 billion or more, depending on the scope of the
definition of HNS and the forms of support―direct, indirect, cash, and in-kind―
under consideration.1 If we were to limit our discussion to “cost sharing,” as a subset
of all HNS, then that figure might be about $2.3 billion instead. South Korea and
Germany, two other countries for which we have some recent quantitative information,
also contribute noteworthy sums. It is also the case that some countries, such as Japan,
have been more inclined to contribute directly and others, such as Germany, have been more inclined to contribute indirectly, through forgone rent and lease payments and
waivers of taxes, fees, and damage claims. We have less evidence of U.S. payments to
other countries. The only concrete figure pertains to U.S. payments to Djibouti, which
amount to about $30 million each year.
From an analytical perspective, the relevance of HNS and U.S. payments differs
depending on the purpose of the analysis. For example, in comparing the costs of current
operations in foreign and U.S. locations, we would seek to assess the difference
between the bottom lines of operating in either location, i.e., the net cost of our presence
with any contributions and including payments. On that basis, only some HNS
and U.S. payments would affect our computations because much of the DoD accounting
data that we employed for our cost analyses are “net” from the outset (i.e., costs that
remain after taking these contributions and expenses into consideration). Care must
be taken, however, to treat both sides of the equation―U.S. and foreign―according
to the same accounting rules and to consider whether additional spending or investments
would be required to change venues. If contemplating a shift from one foreign
location to another, the data on HNS and U.S. payments could play a much larger
part in a comparative assessment. For example, if the U.S. posture were to shift to lessdeveloped
parts of the world, it seems likely that HNS would drop and U.S. payments
would increase.
We begin this chapter with a brief introduction to the terminology associated
with HNS and U.S. payments to host nations and follow with an overview of historical
and contemporary data sources. Next, we present the data on HNS and U.S. payments
and discuss the relevance of those data to the analysis of postures. In addition to bilateral
flows, i.e., HNS and U.S. payments, NATO allies―including the United States―
also undertake multilateral cost sharing, through common- and joint-funded budgets,
such as the NSIP. We consider the scope and relevance of NSIP funds separately. We
also discuss a recent congressional proposal to increase data collection.
Terminology and Data Sources
Because the choice of a particular definition can affect the calculation of the amounts
of support and U.S. payments, possibly by multiple orders of magnitude, we explain
our use of the terms in this report. The Department of Defense Dictionary of Military
and Associated Terms provides a formal definition of the overarching concept of HNS,
per se, but it does not define “cost sharing,” “burden sharing,” or other terms that
infuse discussions about bilateral flows.
Definitions of Host-Nation Support, U.S. Payments, and Related Concepts
The DoD dictionary of military terminology defines HNS as “civil and/or military
assistance rendered by a nation to foreign forces within its territory during peace time, crises or emergencies, or war based on agreements mutually concluded between
nations.”2 In common usage, HNS tends to be associated with a broad range of contributions,
most typically identified as either “cash” or “in-kind” support, on the one
hand, and either “direct” or “indirect” support, on the other hand, and designated for
the purposes of “cost sharing,” “burden sharing,” and/or “relocation.”
The distinctions among the different contributions merit clarification. Cost sharing
appears to be a subset of burden sharing, only some of which is HNS. USFK3
defines cost sharing as “allied cash assistance and in-kind contributions in support of
stationed U.S. forces” [italics added] that “can take the form of direct contributions such
as direct payment for facilities improvement or indirect forgone rents and waived tax
revenue.” It describes cost sharing as “one component of the larger entity referred to as
burden-sharing,” which it defines as “allied sharing of the full range of mutual security
responsibilities in the common defense. . . .” Working from that description, a host
nation’s cost-sharing contributions would almost certainly constitute HNS, whereas
some of its burden-sharing contributions, such as those for force provision in joint
operations, might not. Moreover, some HNS could fall outside the scope of cost sharing,
if, strictly speaking, cost sharing refers solely to “stationed forces” and does not
include contributions to support other forms of military presence.4
Although we could find no formal explanation of the position of relocation assistance
in relation to HNS, cost sharing, or burden sharing, one could argue that some
of those funds would constitute cost sharing; in practice, it tends to be cordoned off
and treated separately in some, but not all, administrative and legislative documents.5

Figure 7.1 summarizes our assessment of the relationships among types of contributions.
It represents relocation assistance with a dotted line, indicative of the ambiguity
of the placement of that assistance in relation to the other forms of contributions.
For purposes of this analysis, we focus our attention on cost sharing and, as much
as the data permit, identify contributions for relocation separately.

<a href= "pic58.html">Figure 7.1 Relationships Among Contributions Consisting of Host-Nation Support, Cost Sharing, Burden Sharing, and Relocation Assistance</a><br><br>


Title 10, U.S.C., sections 2350j, “Burden sharing contributions by designated
countries and regions,” and 2350k, “Relocation within host nation of elements of armed
forces overseas,” delineate the circumstance under which the Secretary of Defense may
accept cash payments from a host nation.6 Under §2350j, the Secretary may accept
cash contributions only for the payment of compensation for local national employees
of DoD, MILCON projects of DoD, and supplies and services of DoD. Section 2350k
authorizes the Secretary to accept cash contributions from foreign nations because of,
or in support of, relocation of elements of U.S. forces from or to any location within
that country, also for specific purposes described therein.

All other contributions, including but not limited to payments that foreign nations
make to individuals, contractors, or other entities for goods or services provided in support
of U.S. operations, thus constitute “in-kind” contributions.7
DoD reports8 define “direct” and “indirect” support from the perspective of the
host nation; that is, if the host nation bears the cost “on budget,” the support is direct,
and if the host nation bears the cost “off budget,” the support is indirect.9
In the context of cost sharing:
Direct cost sharing includes costs borne by host nations in support of U.S. forces for
rents on privately owned land and facilities, labor, utilities, and vicinity improvements.
Indirect cost sharing includes forgone rents and revenues, including rents
on government-owned land and facilities occupied or used by U.S. forces at no or
reduced cost to the United States, and tax concessions or customs duties waived
by the host nation.10
Table 7.1 provides a matrix that categorizes illustrative examples of contributions
(primarily cost sharing) on two dimensions: direct versus indirect support and cash
versus in-kind support.
<a href= "pic59.html">Table 7.1 Forms of Support and Illustrative Examples of Contributions</a><br><br>
We are not aware of any formal or commonly accepted definition of the term
“U.S. payments” and have developed our own definition. For purposes of this analysis,
we focus on direct payments to host-nation governments made explicitly for the purpose
of supporting the U.S. overseas posture in accordance with the NDAA’s stated
focus on direct payments for use of facilities, ranges, and lands. We do not consider
U.S. funding for security assistance (e.g., International Military Education and Training
and Foreign Military Financing), development assistance (e.g., Overseas Development
Assistance), or U.S. payments to other entities (e.g., employees and contractors)
for goods or services that might affect the host-nation economy but are not paid to the
host-nation government.
Sources of Data on Host-Nation Support and U.S. Payments
Up until 2004, DoD provided aggregate national-level information on direct and
indirect cost sharing and other forms of “contributions toward the common defense
and mutual security of the United States and its allies” in an annual report titled
Allied Contributions to the Common Defense. This report presented DoD’s assessment
of the absolute and relative contributions of the United States’ NATO allies, Pacific
allies (Australia, Japan, and South Korea), and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
nations. To gather data for the report, particularly the bilateral cost-sharing components,
DoD relied heavily on contract support11 and extensive inputs from U.S. embassies
and DoD components, including the military departments and commands.12,13
The annual reports were useful insomuch as they provided estimates of the dollar value
of direct and indirect cost sharing for most NATO, Pacific, and GCC allies, but they
provided little insight into the underlying composition of that support in each case and
with little documentation; hence, they are virtually impossible to validate or reproduce.
We found no comparable source of information on past U.S. payments.
The data for recent years are less readily available. At present, there are no centralized
sources of information on contributions or U.S. payments, other than those pertaining
to cash support and multilateral cost sharing. To the extent that bilateral information
is available, it must be culled―oftentimes in broadly descriptive fragments―from
a variety of documents, websites, and individuals, including the following:
 provisions of SOFAs that pertain to indirect support, e.g., those addressing tax
and other fee waivers14

 special measures agreements (SMAs) that the United States has negotiated and
implemented with Japan and South Korea
 acquisition and cross-servicing agreements that are negotiated between the United
States and its allies to allow U.S. forces to exchange most common types of support,
including food, fuel, transportation, ammunition, and equipment
 various implementing agreements, technical arrangements, and diplomatic statements
 annual, mandatory reports that DoD provides to Congress on cash payments
made from host nations to the United States under §2350j and §2350k, Title 10,
U.S.C., Subtitle A, part 4, Chapter 138, Subchapter II
 official government websites of the host nations themselves
 representatives of EUCOM, USFK, USFJ, and others with on-the-ground knowledge
of U.S. operations and related support.
Of these sources, only the annual reports on cash payments provide a comprehensive,
regularized accounting of the flow of funds. Those reports tally cash payments to
the United States from Japan, South Korea, and Kuwait.
Data on the NATO allies’ NSIP contributions are more readily available, e.g., in
NATO, U.S., and other budget documents, than those relating to bilateral support.
We discuss those data in a separate section on multilateral flows.

	<hr><br>

The final report in the Allied Contributions to the Common Defense series was released in
200415 and provides data on NATO, Pacific, and GCC allies’ bilateral direct and indirect
cost sharing for 2002. The data suggest that host-nation cost sharing is substantial
in absolute terms and for relative basing costs, but that the roles of direct and indirect
support differ by country and region. In 2002, cost sharing was reported to amount
to just over 50 percent of basing costs (see Table 7. 2), on average, among the NATO,
Pacific, and GCC allies; however, the bulk of all bilateral cost sharing among NATO
allies―including Germany―was indirect, and the bulk of all cost sharing among
Pacific allies―Japan especially―and GCC allies was direct.
As a general matter, we caution against drawing comparisons between the figures
for 2002 and those available for recent years. Our reasoning is two-fold: first, lacking
insight to the composition of the earlier figures―what they include and exclude in
each case―we cannot assume comparability across the years; second, the world―and the U.S. military’s role in it―has changed over the past decade. Nevertheless, in some
limited circumstances, subject to caveats, we make a small number of comparisons
below.  

<a href= "pic60.html">Table 7.2 U.S. Stationed Military Personnel and Bilateral Cost Sharing in 2002 (measured in nominal $ millions at 2002 exchange rates)</a><br><br>


Over the eight-year period for which we have roughly comparable data,16 the
bottom line is consistent. The aggregate figure varied within a range of about $7 billion
to $8.5 billion (Figure 7.2). Notwithstanding the substantial contributions of U.S.
allies to the U.S. overseas presence, sizable amounts of U.S.-borne costs remain in
place. If U.S. allies were bearing about 50 percent of the cost burden in 2002, then the
United States would, by definition, have been bearing most, if not all, of the remaining
burden17; on that basis, the cost to the United States over

Analysis of Contemporary Data on Host-Nation Support and U.S. Payments
Contemporary data on HNS and U.S. payments are scattered across a variety of
sources, including SOFAs, SMAs, and acquisition and cross-servicing agreements;
annual reports on cash payments; DoD budget documents; and the official government
websites of the host nations. Our review of those sources suggests that information
on HNS is more readily available than information on U.S. payments.
Host Nations’ Contributions to the United States
Tables 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 collectively summarize our “state of knowledge” regarding the
contributions of the 12 countries we examined. Table 7.3 indicates, in the broadest
possible terms, the forms of support―cash, in-kind, direct, and indirect―that we can
associate definitively with each country. That we do not associate a country with a particular
form of support does not necessarily imply that the country does not, in fact,
provide such support, only that we could find no corroborating evidence.18 (Cash support
is an exception. Reporting under Title 10, U.S.C. is mandatory, thus, any country
that is not included in DoD’s annual report to Congress, by definition, does not make
cash contributions.) Table 7.4 distinguishes particular types of in-kind contributions,
and Table 7.5 describes Japan, South Korea, and Kuwait’s cash payments.

<a href= "pic62.html">Table 7.3 Forms of Support Associated with Countries of Interest</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic63.html">Table 7.4 Types of In-Kind Contributions Associated with Countries of Interest</a><br><br>


<a href= "pic64.html">Table 7.5 Types of Cash Payments Associated with Countries of Interest (based on U.S. fiscal year estimates and measured in nominal $ millions</a><br><br>


Much of our state of knowledge regarding bilateral contributions, especially indirect
support, is only qualitative and general; for example, we can say that a country,
such as Spain, adheres to the provisions of the NATO SOFA and therefore provides
the United States with income tax waivers or other personnel benefits, as shown above.
Only in the case of cash payments, which must be reported annually, can we confidently
track the flow of funds comprehensively (see Table 7.5).
Together, the cash payments of Japan, South Korea, and Kuwait amounted to
over $900 million annually from 2009 to 2011, of which about 94 percent pertained
to cost sharing and 6 percent pertained to relocation.

Below, we present estimates of bilateral support from Japan, South Korea, and
Germany. For those countries, we have enough information to tell cogent stories about
the nature of their support, but lacking any other public information on Kuwait’s contributions, we end our discussion of that country here. For readers with less interest in
this amount of detail, we suggest skimming the discussion of the three countries and
moving to the next section, on U.S. payments to host nations.

	<b><a name="T3">Japan’s Contributions to the United States</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Of the 12 countries under consideration, we have the most comprehensive data for
Japan, partly because Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MOD) and Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) post relatively detailed information about contributions on their respective websites,19 and partly because USFJ representatives provided us with information
on trends.20 We have additional information on the cost-sharing and training
relocation contributions that are covered under the U.S.-Japan SMA for the period
2011 to 2015 and on the subset of all contributions that are made in cash and thus
covered under Title 10, U.S.C., mandatory reporting requirements.21 The MOD and
MOFA data are not fully consistent, but are mostly reconcilable. We have adopted the
MOD estimates because they are available for four years, 2009C2012, whereas the
MOFA figures are available only for 2012. We address the difference between the two
agencies’ estimates in the notes and text that accompany the data.
Table 7.6 reports the estimates found in the budget documents on the MOD
website, using the terminology of those documents; Table 7.7 reports figures from the
MOFA website, some of which might already be built into the MOD budget estimates
and some of which are not because they either refer to other agencies or accrue “off
budget.” Because the U.S.-Japan SMA is specified in yen and the Japanese agencies
report contributions in yen, we provide two segments of Table 7.6: Segment “a” shows
the amounts in yen and segment “b” shows them in U.S. Dollars. Both versions provide
detailed breakouts for what the MOD describes as “cost-sharing for stationing
USFJ.”

<a href= "pic65.html">Table 7.6 Japanese Funding for Cost Sharing and Other Purposes (based on Japanese fiscal year estimates)</a><br><br>


The amounts shown in Table 7.6, absent the addendum in Table 7.7, would all constitute
direct support because they are MOD budget figures and are, by definition, “on
budget.” However, the aggregate figure, about $6.5 billion, represents an upper bound
in that the amounts shown for base promotion include unspecified sums for purposes
unrelated to U.S. facilities, and at least some of the amounts shown for the Special
Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO), realignment, and relocation might fall outside
the purview of HNS as we depict it in Figure 7.1. On the basis of our crosswalk of
the MOD and MOFA data and information provided in the underlying documents,
we do believe, however, that a significant fraction of the unspecified base-promotion
amounts could involve U.S. facilities. In the case of local community expenses, the
share pertaining to U.S. facilities could be almost 50 percent, and, in the case of facility
rentals, compensation expenses, etc., that share could be as much as 90 percent.
Applying those shares to each category, the revised aggregate figure would be about
$5.6 billion.


Most of the identified support is in-kind. Japan uses cash to pay for all―or nearly
all―utility cost sharing and a substantial share of training relocation, but not the rest.
The cash payments for utilities reported in Table 7.5 map reasonably well to the dollar
values of those shown in Table 7.6, notwithstanding the differences in fiscal years (the
Japanese fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31). The mapping is less straightforward
for the training relocation contributions; the cash payments appear to cover all of
the training relocation contributions covered under the SMA and at least some of those
covered elsewhere. We know less about the amounts shown in the MOFA-derived
addendum (Table 7.7) except that some refer to ministries other than the MOD and
some, i.e., the estimated costs of government-owned land, constitute indirect support.




<a href= "pic66.html">Table 7.7 Addendum to Table 7.6 (in nominal billions of yen and millions of U.S. dollars, based on Japanese fiscal year estimates)</a><br><br>


Given the scope of coverage of the MOD and MOFA estimates (see Table 7.8
also), it seems plausible that a tally of some combination of the amounts shown in
Tables 7.6 and 7.7 would capture all or nearly all of Japan’s direct support. The numbers
also make sense in terms of their order of magnitude relative to Japan’s reported
cost-sharing contributions in 2002. For 2012, the total upper bound amount shown
in Table 7.6, version “b,” is about $6.5 billion, of which about $2.3 billion constitutes
“cost sharing for stationing USFJ.” Adding the strictly additional direct component
(non-MOD contributions) from the addendum in Table 7.7 brings the total to about
$7.0 billion, and adding the indirect component (estimated cost of government-owned
land) brings the total for all purposes, including some potentially outside the scope of
our analysis, to about $9.1 billion. On the basis of the relative allocations of direct and
indirect support shown in Table 7.2, it is also plausible that the MOFA estimate for the
value of land provision accounts for most or all of Japan’s indirect support.22
The explicit cost-sharing component of the base promotion measures, shown in
Table 7.6, also includes most of the contributions covered under the U.S.-Japan SMA.

In our parlance, we might not adhere to the MOD’s delineation of cost sharing: We
might view some of the other elements of “promotion of base measures” as “cost sharing,”
such as those pertaining to facility rentals, but cannot readily parse them; at the
same time, we might also choose to subtract some of the amounts covering training
relocation costs. Another 5.1 billion yen of SMA funding―also designated for training
relocation needs―appears to fall under the SACO and realignment categories.
The text of the “Security Consultative Committee Document,” issued jointly by
the U.S. Secretaries of State and Defense and the Japanese Ministers for Foreign Affairs
and Defense in June 201123 (a “2+2” statement) defines HNS in terms of the funding
in Table 7.6 under the heading “cost sharing for stationing USFJ”:
The Ministers confirmed that the overall level of HNS is to be maintained at the
Japanese Fiscal Year (JFY) 2010 level (bearing in mind the budget of 188.1 billion
yen in the JFY 2010) over the five years of the SMA period [starting in JFY
2011].24 The Ministers affirmed that the two governments will implement a phased
reduction of labor and utilities costs that the Government of Japan funds, while
adding the amount of this reduction to the Facilities Improvement Program (FIP)
funding in the current SMA period (FIP funding over the current SMA period is
to be no less than 20.6 billion yen per year).
The texts of the U.S.-Japan SMA and the 2+2 statement and discussions of the
content of those documents found on the MOFA website and in government-togovernment
exchanges provide additional detail on the allocations of Japan’s contributions
to different forms of cost sharing.25 According to those sources, Japan committed
to covering the costs of a progressively smaller workforce (declining from 23,055 to
22,625 workers); a progressively smaller share of stationing related utility expenditures
(76 percent to 72 percent, capped at 24.9 billion yen); and a minimum level of FIP
(20.6 billion yen) that could be made higher by the amounts equal to any reductions in
expenditures for labor and utilities. The expenditures for labor and utility cost sharing
accrue under the SMA and those related to the FIP accrue outside the SMA.
Appendix H summarizes this information and provides yen and U.S. dollar estimates
for 2010 and the SMA period (2011C2015). In that appendix, we draw directly
from the figures in Table 7.6 for the 2011 and 2012 estimates and extrapolate from
those estimates, using data on wage growth, utility cost growth, and exchange rates, to make projections for 2013C2015. We include the estimates for 2010 because the
SMA and 2+2 statement treat it as a benchmark. Assuming that the 188.1 billion yen
commitment is not an upper limit,26 we conclude that labor cost sharing will increase
slightly, from about 114 billion yen in 2010 to about 115.8 billion yen in 2015; utility
cost sharing will remain at 24.9 billion yen, and the FIP will remain at 20.6 billion yen.
The total in U.S. dollars for all three types of contributions in 2015 would be about
$2 billion.
Given likely increases in the costs of labor and energy in Japan, we do not expect
to see any change in contributions to the FIP above or beyond the annual 20.6 billion
yen minimum. Recent increases in the cost of labor in Japan have been small, but
plausibly still large enough to offset the declining numbers of workers; recent increases
in the costs of energy in Japan have been substantially larger and almost certainly large
enough to offset the declining shares of utility expenditures.
USFJ provided us with data on trends in contributions over a 35-year
period, beginning in 1978 and ending in 2012.27 The data are denominated in
nominal (then-year) yen and consist of funding for cost sharing, as defined in
Table 7.6; that is, they include funding under the SMA (utilities, labor, and training
relocation), the FIP, and measures for base personnel. As provided, the yendenominated
data suggest a mostly steady decline in HNS from 2002 to the present
(Figure 7.3).28 The USFJ briefing that is the source of the data also predicts downward
pressure on HNS, especially utility cost sharing, in the future. However, when the
funding is converted to U.S. dollars, the trend reverses. Although Japan makes its contributions
in yen, this conversion is reasonable, as, absent support from the Japanese
government, the U.S. military would cover its costs from a U.S.-dollarCdenominated
budget―subject to a floating exchange rate.
Table 7.8 summarizes our understanding of Japan’s contributions to the United
States in terms of the categories presented in Table 7.1.

The second-most comprehensive set of data is available for South Korean contributions.
For this country, we have data on cost sharing under the U.S.-South Korea SMA and  for cash payments under Title 10, U.S.C., but little else.29 The current and soon-toexpire
SMA spans the period 2009C2013 and addresses labor cost sharing, logistics
cost sharing, and South KoreaCfunded construction. The contribution of South Korea
for 2009 was 760 billion Korean won, amounting to almost $600 million in then-year
dollars; the contributions for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 were to be determined by
increasing the contributions of the previous year by the rate of inflation two years prior,
not to exceed 4 percent (Table 7.9).

<a href= "pic69.html">Table 7.9 South Korea’s Cost-Sharing and Relocation Contributions (measured in nominal currency)</a><br><br>


Some but not all of South Korea’s cash payments correspond to commitments
under the U.S.-South Korea SMA. Cash payments cover the labor costs associated
with the SMA, amounting to no more than 71 percent of the labor costs for USFK’s
Korean workforce (not all of USFK’s Korean-national workers are compensated under
the SMA program); a declining fraction of the construction costs associated with the
SMA; and relocation costs that accrue outside the SMA.30 They do not cover any of
the logistics costs associated with the SMA; those contributions are solely “in-kind.”
Regarding construction, South Korea committed to a shift from cash to in-kind contributions
to be implemented fully by 2011, except for expenses associated with “design
and construction oversight of facilities”; in 2009, the cash component of South KoreaC
funded construction was 70 percent, and by 2011 that share was expected to drop to
12 percent. Applying that trajectory, Appendix H provides estimates of South Koreafunded
construction, cash and in-kind, for 2009C2012.
Table 7.9 reports on “estimable” direct support―from South Korea to the United
States―but we cannot say whether it reports the totality of such support. A comparison
of the magnitude of recent and 2002 levels suggests that it might, but the scope of
coverage (see Table 7.10) looks narrow in comparison with Table 7.1.



We have only qualitative information on South Korea’s indirect support―for
example Article IV of the SMA references tax exemptions―but the historical record
suggests that they are substantial. In 2002, for example, South Korea’s indirect support
amounted to more than 40 percent of the resources that it directed to cost sharing.
If one were to assume a roughly similar split between direct and indirect cost sharing
in the current era, admittedly a strong assumption, South Korea’s total cost-sharing
contribution could have amounted to about $1.27 to $1.33 billion in 2011, if Table 7.9
does, in fact, report the totality of all of South Korea’s direct support, and depending on the exclusion or inclusion of cash payments to cover relocation expenses. We offer
this estimate not as a valid, accurate, or even plausible estimate of the current level
of South Korea’s total contributions, but as indicative of the level of our uncertainty
around that total: It could be as little as $733 million, if considering only estimable
direct support, excluding relocation (Table 7.9); as much as $1.3 billion, if looking at
the extrapolated figure for direct and indirect support, including relocation (Table 7.9);
or perhaps some other number entirely.
Table 7.10 summarizes our understanding of South Korea’s contributions to the
United States in terms of the categories presented in Table 7.1.

	<b><a name="T5">Germany’s Contributions to the United States</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
For the Federal Republic of Germany, we have incomplete data on HNS for a single
year―2009―drawn largely from correspondence between U.S. and German government
officials. By inference and supported by discussions with EUCOM personnel,
we know that all of that HNS, be it direct or indirect, is “in-kind”―if Germany were
to provide the United States with any cash support, that support would be listed in
DoD’s annual report to Congress. A survey of documents related to the stationing of
U.S. forces in Germany, including the NATO SOFA, as well as the officials’ correspondence
provided by EUCOM and USAREUR, indicate that Germany’s indirect support
includes forgone customs duties, forgone income taxes, personnel benefits (such as
accepting U.S. Drivers Licenses without fees), and forgone rent on facilities provided
by Germany for use by the United States. Additionally, direct support takes the form
of land, infrastructure, construction, damage claim offsets, and compensation to local
communities.
In Appendix H, we present a compilation of the available quantitative data,
most if not all of which refers to direct support, with breakouts for each line item. In
Table 7.11, we present the compilation in three, aggregated categories.

<a href= "pic71.html">Table 7.11 Summary Compilation of Data on Germany’s Contributions to the United States in 2009</a><br><br>


The data compilation provides evidence of contributions amounting to about 600
million euros or $830 million in 2009. The total is subject to at least two noteworthy
caveats. First, much if not all of Germany’s indirect support, such as the value of for-gone sales tax associated with commissaries located on U.S. bases, is not captured in
the table because we lack the data to do so. Thus, we can add the numbers to yield a
total for 2009, but it is not the actual total. Looking back to the historical data presented
in Table 7.2, the vast majority of Germany’s contributions a decade ago were
indirect, suggesting that today’s actual total could be much higher. In addition, the
officials’ correspondence makes reference to an estimated value of the land provided by
the Federal Republic of Germany to U.S. forces of about 5 billion euros. However, the
correspondence goes on to indicate that these lands “have special value for the military
user” and no market value calculations have been made for the areas.31 Because we
have no information about the method used to calculate the 5 billion euro estimate, we
cannot offer a firm interpretation and do not include the figure in Table 7.11. Second,
87 percent of the total―some 520 million euros or $722 million―relates to construction,
an activity that is inherently “lumpy” as one-time charges, such as for consolidation
and relocations, heavily impact this category. For that reason, we cannot say what
the numbers might look like in another year.
Remaining Countries’ Contributions to the United States
For the remaining countries, we have little or no quantitative information, and in only
the rarest of circumstances do we have much qualitative information. In the case of


Italy, for example, we have an overview of HNS provided by a EUCOM expert and
some detail―albeit almost entirely qualitative―on contributions associated with a
specific facility, i.e., Sigonella, that are spelled out in a technical arrangement.
Our information about Italy’s contributions―also entirely “in-kind”―derives
from a survey of documents (e.g., the NATO SOFA, the memoranda of understanding
concerning the use of installations and infrastructure by U.S. forces in Italy, and
the technical arrangement regarding installations and infrastructure in use by the U.S.
forces in Sigonella) and from an issue paper prepared by a EUCOM subject-matter
expert on “Italian Contributions to Forward Deployed U.S. Forces.”32 According to
the documents, Italy provides a variety of indirect support (forgone customs duties,
forgone income tax receipts, and other minor benefits to U.S. personnel) and direct
support (facility administration, repairs and maintenance, and security personnel).
In addition, the EUCOM issue paper indicates that the government of Italy forgoes
rent on facilities and provides utility infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, payments
of a portion of damage claims, and compensation to local communities to help
offset U.S. forcesCrelated costs. We have little information about the magnitude of
Italy’s contributions, but we have enough to affirm that the aggregate figure would
be non-negligible. For example, among its non-recurring contributions, the EUCOM
issue paper33 indicates that the government of Italy has spent over 200 million euros to
bolster the roads around Aviano Air Base and 10 million euros planning road upgrades
around facilities in the Dal Molin and Vicenza areas, and that another 200 million
euros will be needed to complete the upgrades.
Another example of the fragmentary nature of the information on HNS can be
found in a USAFE-provided issue paper.34 In that paper, USAFE indicates that they
benefit from force protection savings that are attributable to co-location at host-nation
facilities. We can infer that such benefits might accrue, for example, in Spain and the
UK, where U.S. forces co-locate at facilities, such as Rota, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF
Lakenheath, but we have no estimates of the dollar value of that co-location. Developing
a dollar-value estimate for force protection, for example, would require specific
information about the service requirement for each location, the share of that requirement
attributable to the U.S. presence, and the costs of provision.
U.S. Payments to Other Countries
The data on U.S. payments to other countries are even scarcer than those on HNS.
They might be scarcer because such payments are less common than HNS or because they are more scattered and sensitive and, therefore, more difficult to obtain.35 Two
types of data sources provide a small amount of insight. The first consists of the body
of agreements that the United States maintains with countries in which it has security
interests; the second consists of EUCOM, USFJ, USFK, and other representatives with
on-the-ground knowledge of operations and financial practices.
Drawing on those sources, we find that the United States
 makes payments of about $30 million annually to Djibouti36
 makes no payments to any NATO allies
 likely makes few or no payments to any European non-NATO allies
 may or may not make any payments to any other host nations.37
The $30 million payment to Djibouti is made in consideration for the access to
and use of the areas and facilities described in the Arrangement in Implementation of the
‘Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government
of the Republic of Djibouti on Access to and Use of Facilities in the Republic of Djibouti’
of February 19, 2003, Concerning the Use of Camp Lemonier and Other Facilities and
Areas in the Republic of Djibouti and its annexes. Under the terms of that implementing
arrangement, any payments made by the United States to Djibouti, consistent with the
land lease of 2003, would be credited against the $30 million. By comparison, a recent
press report notes that Djibouti, which hosts France’s largest military base in Africa,
receives another $36.75 million per year in rent payments from that country.38 

Treatment of Bilateral Flows in Posture Analysis
In this section, we discuss the interpretation of the data on host-nation contributions
and U.S. payments. We find that the role of the various bilateral flows in analysis
depends on the context; for example, whether the purpose of the analysis is to
 estimate host nation costs
 evaluate U.S. fiscal exposure
 compare costs of alternative basing locations.
Differences among analytical contexts necessitate case-by-case consideration. To
that end, we offer a simple framework for assessing the relevance of different forms of
support to particular analytical efforts. The framework decomposes costs by bearer.
The total cost of maintaining U.S. forces in a particular location can be described in
terms of costs borne by the United States and costs borne by others, specifically the
host nation:39
Total cost = U.S.-borne costs + U.S. payments + HNS.
“U.S.-borne costs” consist of all direct expenses of maintaining the U.S. presence,
except those reflected in “U.S. payments”; “U.S. payments” consist of payments
made by the United States to the host nation for use of facilities, ranges, and lands; and
“HNS” consists of direct (cash and in-kind) support and indirect (in-kind) support.
Estimating Host-Nation Costs
The cost to the host nation is the resource value of the HNS that it contributes, less
some fraction of the amount of U.S. payments that it receives. Regardless of the value
that the United States places on a particular good or service, the provision of that
good or service, as embodied in HNS, represents a real cost to the host nation if the
host nation could have put the underlying resources to use elsewhere and if the value
attributed to HNS reflects the value of those resources in the alternative uses, i.e., the
market value or opportunity cost associated with the resources.40 Similarly, the value
of underlying resources comes into play in assessing the relationship between U.S. payments
and host-nation costs. If the amount of U.S. payments exceeds the market value
or opportunity cost of the facilities, ranges, or land under consideration, then that
additional amount would offset the host nation’s cost.


The host nation’s cost could be taken as an indicator of that country’s commitment
to the presence of U.S. forces; however, a country lacking financial ability may
have a high level of commitment to the U.S. presence, even if it cannot formalize
that commitment through HNS. Indeed, that country might require remuneration to
counter the strain that hosting would otherwise place on its limited resources. Recognizing
the role of financial ability in establishing the terms of support and payments,
we caution against over-interpreting either a lack of support or, conversely, a request
for payments.
Evaluating Fiscal Exposure
Fiscal exposure, as we use the term, refers to the amount that the United States could
be called upon to pay, were HNS to decline in a particular venue. If a host nation were
to determine that it would or could not continue to provide support at the current
level, e.g., for lack of budgetary and other resources, the United States could find itself
“on the hook” for the amount of the shortfall, if it were to remain in that country.
Alternatively, the United States might choose to shed some activities, hence costs, but
if all the activities are necessary to maintain the U.S. presence, it could lack the flexibility
to do so. Thus, HNS, or some fraction of HNS, can represent a financial risk.
Comparing Costs of Illustrative Postures
To compare the costs of illustrative postures―as in Chapter Ten, based on the models
developed in Chapter Eight―we would look at the bottom lines for U.S. costs associated
with maintaining a U.S. presence at each location under each configuration of
U.S. forces. This bottom line can be represented as either the total cost, less HNS, or
the sum of U.S.-borne costs and U.S. payments; however, whether we would need to
factor any HNS and U.S. payments into our calculations depends on the composition
of the data that we start with, the methods that we use to make our calculations, and
how we define “maintaining a U.S. presence.”
Because we work mostly with DoD cost data―which are primarily but not
entirely accounting data―we are especially interested in the ways in which host-nation
contributions and U.S. payments filter through the DoD cost accounts. In many or
most instances, the DoD cost data are already net of HNS. Netting occurs automatically
when the host nation’s contribution is in-kind and takes the form of a good or
service, so that the contribution is not recorded directly in the DoD cost accounts, or
when the host nation reimburses U.S. expenditures.41,42 In short, DoD cost data and the cost modeling in Chapter Eight largely reflect net DoD spending, with accounting
for HNS “built in” either through the absence of DoD spending for a service or
good or host-nation reimbursement for the same. Albeit less often, the data might also
include elements of U.S. payments that flow through ordinary program accounts.
In those instances in which the data are already net of host-nation contributions
or include U.S. payments, we do not need to draw the bilateral flows into our calculations;
if we did, we would be double-counting them. For example, were we to subtract
Japan’s $2.3 billion cost-sharing contributions from a data-derived estimate of the costs
of U.S. operations in Japan, our “bottom line” could be as much as $2.3 billion too low
because much if not all of that $2.3 billion flows directly from the government of Japan
to goods and services providers, as is the case of in-kind support for labor cost sharing
and facility improvements, or reimburses a U.S. expenditure, as occurs in the context
of utility cost sharing. Similarly, if some fraction of the U.S. payment to Djibouti were
to enter into the DoD cost accounts as an ordinary expense, e.g., an amount used to
cover a lease, we would not want to count it twice.
It is also possible that some host-nation contributions serve a purpose that is
outside the scope of our analysis; that is, they do not line up with our definition of
“maintaining a U.S. presence.” The contributions might, for example, serve to expand
capacity, enhance capabilities, or enable a change of mission. Some of the Japan’s contributions
toward facility improvements or South Korea’s contributions toward construction
might do more than restore, modernize, or recapitalize existing facilities;
some relocation contributions might also fall outside the bounds of an estimate of the
ongoing costs of sustaining overseas posture.
By and large, we conclude that a tally of the DoD cost data can come close to
approximating the sum of U.S.-borne costs and U.S. payments in many environments,
absent any further adjustments. Nevertheless, it is still possible that some of the data
are not fully net of HNS, as should be typical, or inclusive of U.S. payments, thus
necessitating adjustments in our calculations. In such cases, we would need to subtract
the un-netted HNS from the cost tally to credit the contribution and add the excluded
U.S. payments to recognize them.43
If comparing the costs of maintaining a presence in two different foreign locations,
one might need to look more closely at the types and amounts of HNS offered― or expected to be offered―and U.S. payments made―or expected to be made―at
the two locations. Just because one nation offers certain types of support or requires
particular payments does not necessitate that another will follow suit. (The indirect
benefits associated with many SOFAs might present an exception.) When the United
States already maintains a presence in one of those locations, we might have the benefit
of tapping into existing data to calculate a bottom line; if the United States is considering
a new location, we would need to construct a bottom line, using our best estimates
of U.S.-borne costs, U.S. payments, and HNS. Should we observe lower-than-expected
costs in some foreign locations, the provision of HNS (cost sharing in particular) might
then explain the gaps, but it would not negate them.
Moreover, the bottom lines that we calculate for each location, whether foreign
or U.S., must address not just the costs of ongoing operations, but those of additional
spending or investments that might be required in the course of a change of posture. If
a move would require investments in new capacity, e.g., for training or other purposes,
then those costs―and the feasibility of building out that capacity―must be factored
into the analysis.44

	<b><a name="T6">NATO Security Investment Program Contributions</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The NSIP is financed by the ministries of defense of each NATO member country,
according to a cost-sharing formula that is based on relative income and other factors,45
and is supervised by the NATO Investment Committee.
NATO describes the NSIP as follows:46
This programme covers major construction and command and control system
investments, which are beyond the national defence requirements of individual
member countries. It supports the roles of the NATO strategic commands by providing
installations and facilities such as air defence communication and information
systems, military headquarters for the integrated structure and for deployed
operations, and critical airfield, fuel systems and harbour facilities needed in support
of deployed forces.
Whereas the data on bilateral contributions and U.S. payments are highly fragmented,
we are able to derive rough estimates of the NATO allies’ contributions to the NSIP―stated as “requirements”―from a combination of U.S. and NATO budget
documents and congressional reports (see Table 7.12).

<a href= "pic72.html">Table 7.12 U.S. and Other Nations’ Contributions to the NATO Security Infrastructure Program (Measured in nominal $US millions unless stated otherwise)</a><br><br>


Under the current cost-sharing formula, the United States covers just over 22 percent
of the total NSIP requirement. The U.S. gross requirement averaged $257 million
annually from 2008 to 2012, with outlays averaging $219 million; other NATO allies’
NSIP requirements averaged about $895 million in aggregate.
Because of the NSIP, the United States bears a smaller share of the infrastructural
costs associated with facilities in which it has a substantial interest than it might otherwise
bear. The DoD budget justification47 for FY 2013 cites three specific examples:

 At Aviano Air Base, Italy, NATO funded over $465 million for the beddown of
two fighter squadrons. The projects include both operational and community
support facilities.
 At Ramstein Air Base, Germany, NATO has invested over $210 million to provide
strategic air transport infrastructure to include parking aprons, freight and
passenger terminal facilities, and a C-5Ccapable hangar.
 At Naval Station Rota, Spain, NATO has invested $151 million in port infrastructure
upgrades to provide logistics support and resupply facilities for NATO
maritime forces. Additional NSIP investment at Rota will manifest itself through
the approved NATO capability package for strategic air transport. This NATO
capability package includes nearly $83 million for infrastructure upgrades and
recoupment eligibility to support NATO’s Southern European Strategic Air
Transport requirements.
Applying the U.S. share of the overall NSIP requirement, approximately 22 percent,
to the NSIP activities in each location, the U.S. share of the NSIP funds in
Aviano, Ramstein, and Rota would have amounted to about $102 million, $46 million,
and $33 million, respectively.
The implications of the NSIP funding for our posture cost analysis are not clearcut.
Depending on the specific nature of the NSIP program activity, the effects of
NSIP funding on the bottom lines at facilities that benefit from NSIP could differ
markedly.48 A key issue is whether the NSIP project activity constitutes recapitalization
or something more. If recapitalization, we would need to make downward adjustments
in our recapitalization estimates in Chapter Eight, amounting to 78 percent of
the NSIP funding amount; if capacity expansion or capability enhancement, we would
not need to make such adjustments. In the latter case, we would treat the funding as
outside the scope of our cost analysis. On the basis of NATO’s and DoD’s characterizations
of the program, it is plausible that the program activity could constitute either,
but that expansions and enhancements might dominate. Thus, even though NSIP cost
sharing represents a cost savings for the United States―assuming that the United
States would have carried either the full burden or a larger share of the burden of the
NSIP-funded infrastructure cost in the absence of NSIP―the flows of funds through
the program might not be analytically “relevant” for estimating the costs of maintaining
the U.S. overseas posture.

Host-Nation Support Data Collection in the Future
At present, the task of reporting comprehensively on either HNS or U.S. payments is
nearly impossible, owing to the scarcity and fragmentation of the data. By analogy, the
task resembles that of an archeologist attempting to reassemble a shattered vase: We
have unearthed a few pieces that are large enough to tell us that we do, indeed, have a
vase, but not enough to know its true dimensions or contours.
In looking to the future, we might first look to the past for insight. The historical
record, specifically DoD’s Allied Contributions to the Common Defense annual reports,
provides insight in terms of both the value it adds and the value it does not add. On the
one hand, the figures contained in those reports suggest the potential importance of
HNS in funding U.S. requirements overseas. By all appearances, U.S. allies have contributed
substantially over the years, both directly and indirectly. On the other hand,
the difficulty of interpreting and replicating those figures speaks to the importance of
thorough documentation. With hindsight, it is apparent that those reports have less
value than they could have had because of the lack of documentation of methods and
sources.
The historical record also provides insight insomuch as it speaks to the possible
costs of any new effort to collect and compile data in the future. As noted previously,
the resources required to generate the annual reports on allied contributions
were non-negligible.
The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013 calls for a return to annual reporting on host
nations’ contributions from 2013 through 2015. Specifically, language in that legislation
requires “the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, [to]
submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the direct, indirect,
and burden sharing contributions49 made by host nations to support overseas United
States military installations and United States Armed Forces deployed in country.” The
report should include “at least” a description of all costs associated with stationing U.S.
Armed Forces in the host nation, a description of the host nation’s contributions,50 and
the methodology and accounting procedures used to measure and track host-nation
contributions.
In requiring DoD to document thoroughly its methodology and accounting
procedures, the legislation stands to increase the value of the end product; however,
that product―and its documentation―will come at a cost. Whether the value of the
endeavor outweighs that cost will depend partly on the reasons for collecting the data.

The data could contribute positively to an evaluation of the costs borne by host nations
or of the fiscal exposure associated with the U.S. military’s overseas presence, but might
not contribute as positively to a comparative assessment of the costs of operating at different
locations. For a comparative analysis of the costs to the United States of basing
in foreign and U.S. locations, the estimates that emerge from our and other analyses
employing DoD cost data may be sufficient, in that they provide reasonable approximations
of the bottom lines of operating at the different locations. The additional data
could play a more important part in a comparison of the costs of basing in different
foreign locations, particularly if those locations differ in either their willingness or ability
to provide support. If the U.S. overseas posture shifts toward less-developed parts
of the world where resources are scarcer, it seems likely that HNS will decline and U.S.
payments will increase. Regardless of the intention, it will be worth gauging the necessary
degree of granularity in the data collection and the merits of further refinements.
Implications of Findings on Host-Nation Support and U.S. Payments
for Postures
This chapter responded to the legislative requirement to determine both direct payments
and other contributions from host nations supporting U.S. military facilities
overseas and direct payments by the United States to host nations for use of facilities,
ranges, and lands. It put these contributions and payments in the context of posture
analysis by reporting on the ways in which they can affect the relative costs of maintaining
an overseas presence and discussing how to factor them into analyses of illustrative
postures. Looking at 12 countries that together account for a large majority
of the United States’ overseas military presence, we found that the data are scant and
scattered, but still sufficient to draw a few general conclusions of relevance to posture
decisions.
A close examination of the available data suggests that HNS offsets a meaningful
share of U.S. overseas basing costs in a number of venues, but that sizable amounts of
U.S.-borne costs remain and that contributions and, to a lesser extent, payments, vary
markedly across locations. The data also suggest that Japan, South Korea, and Germany
are among the biggest contributors of HNS to the United States, but the limitations
of the data, including the lack of availability for other countries, make it difficult
to draw cross-country comparisons. We note that some countries, such as Japan, have
been more inclined to make direct contributions and others, such as Germany, have
been more inclined to make indirect contributions. While direct contributions can
be difficult to quantify and value, it can be even more difficult to quantify and value
indirect contributions, which include forgone rent and lease payments and waivers of
taxes, fees, and damage claims.

In contemplating a move from an existing foreign facility to a U.S. location, the
data that we use to develop our cost estimates in Chapters Eight and Ten should yield
reasonable approximations of the bottom lines of operating at either location, with
little need for adjustment. The DoD spending data that we employ in our analyses are
by definition net of most if not all host-nation contributions. In most instances, the
data are either inherently net (i.e., the host nation pays for the good or service directly)
or already netted for us. Nevertheless, we might still need to factor in some U.S. payments,
as would be the case were we to develop a cost estimate for Djibouti.
For a posited move from one foreign location to another foreign location, or from
the United States to a new foreign location, key considerations would include the willingness
and ability of alternative hosts to provide HNS and their need for payments.
Countries experiencing greater fiscal hardship might be less willing or able to provide
support and might be more needful of payments, resulting in higher costs to the
United States, assuming all else to be equal. Although not a focus of this chapter, the
last point merits comment. In reality, all else may not be equal. The calculation of the
bottom line for the United States―that is, the sum of U.S.-borne costs and U.S. payments―
will depend not just on the amount of HNS and U.S. payments that prevail
in a particular location, but also on the costs of obtaining goods and services in that
location. If a country is relatively expensive to operate in because labor, energy, and
other inputs are especially costly, the bottom line for the United States could still be
relatively high, even with substantial HNS and no U.S. payments.
Thus, for the purposes of examining the cost effects of posture changes with
respect to those locations in which we currently operate, the existing cost data can be
used to effectively support the analyses. In contrast, where posture options would contemplate
facilities in nations in which the United States does not have existing facilities,
cost estimating would be more uncertain and have to rely on either analogous situations
or discussions with the prospective host nation. Moreover, it would be important
to consider whether additional spending or investments would be required to change
venues, either from a foreign to U.S. location or one foreign to another foreign location.
If one location presents a full complement of facilities in good condition and another
requires ground-up construction or major R&M or recapitalization, the costs of shifting
from one location to another could be greater than an analysis of current operating
costs might suggest.

	<b><a name="T7">Chapter eight Relative Costs of Overseas Basing and Rotational Presence</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
This chapter lays out the analyses we conducted to determine the incremental costs
of maintaining the broad range of U.S. installations and forces overseas―by region
and type―versus in the United States, and it explains how we embedded the results
of these analyses in models that provide a policy-relevant way of comparing how total
DoD costs are likely to change as the result of posited posture changes. In doing so,
this chapter describes three cost-assessment methodologies and the derived cost models
developed to comprehensively estimate the cost effects of changes in posture. The first
methodology determines the relative recurring costs of stationing forces and operating
military facilities and training ranges overseas compared with the United States,
accounting for any costs that would simply transfer from one installation or region to
another versus those that would actually change from a DoD standpoint.1 The second
assesses the recurring costs of rotational presence, a possible alternative to permanent
presence, for different types of operational units to different regions. The third methodology
determines one-time investment costs to transition from one posture to another.
Together, the three resulting models enable estimates of how changes to posture would
affect total DoD costs. The models and their parameters are also informative by themselves
for understanding how overseas posture, and changes to it, affects costs.
To conduct the analyses and develop the models, we collected data from each
service across all relevant budget accounts―not just those directly associated with
maintaining installations, such as operations and maintenance funding for installation
support―and from relevant DoD agencies to get a comprehensive picture that is
broader than that typically generated when examining the costs of maintaining facilities
and forces overseas. Additionally, we developed the cost models to get insights into
the incremental costs of overseas presence, as opposed to only determining the actual
costs in given locations. This was necessary to estimate the cost effects of different

posture policy options from a total DoD standpoint. It is only through these models
that we could separate out the costs that would likely change with a modification to
posture versus those costs that would shift to another location, which necessitated the
decomposition of several costs components into fixed and variable cost elements, as
described in the chapter. Budget data do not neatly categorize into these two categories,
which is why could not just use raw budget data to assess the costs associated with
overseas presence. And the data in some budget accounts that are affected by location
and assignment policies, such as allowances in the military personnel accounts, are not
binned and aggregated by location, further necessitating analysis of budget data and
model development.
In this chapter’s introduction, we first define several terms, summarize our analytic
approach, discuss the limitations of our approach, and preview the findings. We
then spend the bulk of the chapter describing our three methodologies and the associated
cost models. Finally, we end the chapter with a discussion of the implications
of this cost analysis for the U.S. military posture. Note that all costs discussed in this
chapter are net of host-nation support.

Definitions of Terms
The following key terms are used throughout the report to characterize costs.
 Incremental cost, or incremental cost difference, refers to the relative difference
in recurring costs (for similar units, populations, or installations) between the
United States and an overseas region or between two different overseas regions.
 Investment cost, or one-time investment cost, refers to the monies needed to shift the
U.S. posture by relocating forces or closing (or vacating) installations.
 Recurring costs refers to the annual costs of operating and sustaining forces and
installations, whether in the United States or overseas. For recurring costs, we
draw a further distinction between fixed and variable recurring costs:
CC Fixed costs refers to the recurring costs that are not sensitive to base population
and is basically invariant to the number of people assigned to the base.
CC Variable costs refers to those costs that vary with base population.2
To further explain fixed and variable recurring costs, if forces shift from overseas
to the United States, the variable costs at the “sending” base decrease, and those at the
“receiving” base increase, by the respective variable costs per person for the associated 


base types and regions. The fixed costs, because they are insensitive to population,
change (i.e., are eliminated or newly added) only if a base is closed or opened.
Approach to Overall Cost Analysis: Constructing Cost Models
This cost analysis is designed to provide: (1) cost assessments of the illustrative posture
options developed in this report, (2) insights about the key drivers of the costs of overseas
posture to facilitate decisionmaking, and (3) a toolkit―or at least a methodology―
that could potentially be used by DoD to make a rough estimate the cost effects of
other change options. To achieve these goals, we had to develop cost models. There are
three reasons why we take this approach and develop cost models.
First, we needed to evaluate a range of posture options that modify the numbers
and locations of overseas forces and bases in different ways to assess the cost impacts.
To do so, our approach had to be flexible enough to estimate the effects of a range of
changes to posture for which not all of the proposed base locations and their hosted
forces would precisely match the attributes of existing bases and the forces assigned
to them―and thus would be expected to have the same costs as one of them. It also
had to be able to produce results for different posture options quickly as we explored
a range of options. This led us to produce generalized models that we could employ to
estimate the likely cost effects of changing base populations, opening or closing bases,
and adding or eliminating rotations―the three inputs to our models―in ways that
do not match existing cases. In essence, we had to be able to “extrapolate” from existing
cases. In creating a general model, we lose some of the fidelity possible from more
granular analysis specific to each unit and location. But in exchange for some loss of
fidelity, we gain flexibility and explanatory power, while preserving sufficient accuracy
to compare the relative costs of different options to determine whether they offer sufficient
merit from a cost-benefit standpoint to analyze in further depth. In short, the
cost models are designed to provide a decision-support tool for the first phase of a posture
options analysis―what options to develop in more depth with sufficient detail to
more precisely determine cost and operational impacts―not to provide the final specific
costs to inform a specific decision or develop budget estimates for posture change
implementation plans.
Second, we sought to provide decisionmakers with tools to quickly develop and
assess a range of options. To readily develop a range of possibilities, it is valuable for
decisionmakers to understand the major factors that drive costs. By understanding
the relative impact of different factors on cost, decisionmakers can better determine
what options are likely to reduce costs, if that is an aim in the development of posture
options, and what options are likely to increase costs the most if they are seeking to
develop posture options to improve or add new capabilities in a region. To do this, our
cost models must parse the important features of overseas posture, but still allow rapid
computations and be easily understood.

Third, we developed cost models to serve analytical purposes. We believe our
approach accurately enables assessment of the relative cost differences for DoD between
various posture options based on how total costs actually change, which cannot be
done simply using raw budget data for bases or forces. The simplest case of reducing
overseas posture is removing the forces from a given base and closing the base altogether.
In that case, one would not actually save the full scope of annual operating
costs at the base. A portion of the costs are fixed costs and would be saved, but another
portion includes variable costs that would still accrue somewhere in DoD but possibly
at a different level. Whether DoD’s annual recurring variable costs associated with the
personnel at the closing base would change depends on whether there is a difference
between the variable costs at the closing base and those at the base(s) receiving the
forces. Thus, one must also understand the cost structure of the receiving base and how
the fixed and variable costs at a base are split. In short, how the costs in a region change
when a base is closed is not what is of interest. Rather, what is of interest is how total
DoD costs change, involving additions and subtractions for every move. Currently, the
DoD data do not readily decompose into these fixed versus variable costs; thus a modeling
approach to distinguish the two is crucial.
To scale total costs to personnel, one must develop some kind of per-person or
per-unit costs to apply to the force types relocating to the United States. Simply dividing
the total support costs at an installation by the total personnel without taking into
account the fixed and variable cost dynamic would overestimate per-person variable
costs and understate fixed costs dramatically. Just assessing the gross costs of maintaining
the current U.S. overseas posture base by base would have been insufficient,
because this would not enable the evaluation of changes at a base except for full closure
and would not enable evaluation of changes to net DoD costs instead of changes at a
regional or base level. This necessitated the development of generalized cost models.
Approach to Individual Cost Models
Recurring Costs of Permanent Posture
To conduct this analysis, we analyzed the costs incurred by forces and installations to
produce cost models based on the ways those activities actually incur costs. To do so,
we grouped costs into four categories: training, personnel-related, installation-related,
and regional logistics:
 Training activity costs are simply the operations and sustainment costs that enable
operational units’ day-to-day operations, excluding the military pay for unit personnel;
they vary in our modeling based on where units are and by unit type.

 Personnel-related costs are allowances and permanent-change-of-station (PCS)
moving costs incurred by DoD.3 In our modeling, we estimate how these costs
vary based on location and service.
 Installation-related costs include facility operations, maintenance, R&M; family
services; morale, welfare, and recreation; medical services; and dependents’ education.
We also include the construction costs to periodically recapitalize infrastructure,
but, because of the cost dynamics, we take a slightly different approach
than for other installation-related costs. In our modeling, installation-related
costs vary based on whether installations open or close and how many people are
at an installation.
 Regional logistics costs are additional logistics costs borne by DoD to support
permanent overseas forces and bases. These costs include additional transportation
costs for overseas delivery of supplies and overseas regional distribution centers,
which form an additional layer of logistics. In our modeling, these costs vary
with the number of people in a region.
Training costs are driven by and assignable to operational units (e.g., a fighter
wing or an infantry brigade) themselves. Data provided by the services indicate that
training costs sometimes vary for like units located in different regions. Some differences
may have to do with differences in the types and frequencies of activities they
conduct (such as partner-nation exercises and training), restrictions on those activities,
or actual cost differentials for the same activities. The annual training cost difference
between the United States and region r for a single unit type j can be expressed as
cjr C cjUS, where cjr is the annual training cost in region r for unit type j, and r = {Pacific,
Europe}. We derive these different costs from service data and models. We apply the
difference in the annual per-unit cost to each instance of a unit relocating from an
overseas region to the United States in our cost estimates for the illustrative postures.
Personnel-related costs are specific to each person based on where they are located,
assignment characteristics, and family status. Allowances are monies provided for specific
needs adjusted for costs specific to a location and the servicemember’s situation
(i.e., living in barracks, on-base housing, or off-base housing, as well as whether accompanied
by dependents) and include housing, the overall cost of living, and compensation
for living apart from their families.4 Additional PCS costs for stationing service
members overseas are incurred because it is more expensive to transport people and
their household goods to and from overseas locations than within the United States.

The rate of PCS moves per person per year may also be higher overseas, depending on
assignment policies. The cost impact from shifting personnel to or from the United
States is Σ(cjr C cjUS)xjr, where cjr C cjUS is the differential cost arising from the difference
between overseas and U.S. cost per person for a person in service j in region r, and xjr
is the number of personnel of service j shifted from or to region r.
For installation-related annual recurring costs, there are fixed-cost components
and variable-cost components. Within installation-related costs, we include installation
support, construction to recapitalize existing infrastructure, and DoD Education
Agency (DODEA) support. For each of these categories of cost in a given region,
the basic model for cost is estimated using a regression model and has the form
cisr = asr + bsr pisr. Here, cisr is the total installation-support cost of installation i of service
s in region r, asr is the fixed-cost component of an installation of service s in region r,
and bsr pisr is the product of the variable cost per person for service s in region r and the
number of personnel at installation i of service s in region r. The personnel we include
as an independent variable (pisr ) are “cost drivers” (the people on an installation who,
by virtue of being assigned there, create demand for installation support), and the personnel
we exclude are part of the installation-support cost dependent variable, cisr. In
applying this model, we explored different variants that employ additional independent
variables. For instance, in the category of installation-support cost, we find that the
fixed cost at an installation sometimes depends on whether operational forces are present
at the installation.
Using this approach for installation-related costs, the annual cost savings (if any)
from relocating forces to the United States depends on whether the sending installation
remains open or closes and whether there is reason to believe the annual fixed
cost at the receiving installation remains the same. In the most common case in our
analysis, the sending installation closes and the fixed cost at the receiving installation is
estimated to not change. In this case, the annual fixed cost at the sending installation
would be saved by DoD. In addition, there might be a savings or increase in variable
cost. However, for installation-support costs, we often find little or no statistically significant
difference between overseas and U.S. estimates of the variable-cost coefficient,
bsr, so the potential savings in the installation-support portion of installation-related
variable costs, (bsr C bUS)pisr, is often zero or relatively low. In other possible cases, the
sending installation remains open and its fixed costs continue to be incurred―hence
no savings in fixed cost.
Finally, regional logistics costs are those borne by DoD to support permanent
overseas forces and bases within a specific region. These costs include the higher cost of
transportation for the delivery of supplies overseas relative to within the United States
and regional distribution centers. Most supplies are brought into the DoD supply
system through U.S. distribution centers or delivered directly from U.S. suppliers. It
simply costs more to ship items overseas than around the United States, and sometimes
it is necessary or costs less to stock them overseas, necessitating regional distribution centers.5 We determine the incremental logistics costs for the delivery of supplies overseas
on a regional basis and then convert this to cost per person.
We aggregate these various cost assessments into a single, recurring-cost model
that estimates the cost impacts of changes in postures. When personnel are relocated
from overseas to the United States as the result of a unit restationing, we apply the
relative training cost differences, if any, for their unit type. We also apply the perperson
costs aggregated from personnel-related costs, the variable-cost component of
installation-related costs support, and per-person regional logistics costs. When a base
is closed, we also apply the fixed-cost component of the installation-support cost to
determine the change in costs.
Before we step into the details of our recurring cost analysis, we briefly discuss
some of the statistical concepts relevant to our analysis. First, sample size was often a
constraining factor for the portions of our analysis where we used regression analysis,
thereby limiting the ability to assess too many different factors and in some cases limiting
the ability to produce significant modeling results. Generally, the sample sizes
for U.S. bases (several dozen data points for each service) were adequate to develop
parameter estimates with reasonable standard errors for statistical significance and that
fit the data well to provide strong explanatory power. The case was rarely the same
for overseas bases. For each service, there were usually 5C10 data points per region, or
even fewer―too few from which to perform separate regression analyses, and usually
too few from which to derive consistent (and reasonable) parameter estimates for each
region separately. Sometimes we overcame this by combining regions to develop an
aggregate overseas estimate, sometimes we excluded one or more outliers in a set typically
associated with unique installation characteristics, and sometimes the data points
were simply too few, and we sought to estimate costs for individual data points (i.e.,
bases) instead of using generalized modeling results.
Finally, we used a linear specification for the relationship of personnel to support
costs, rather than an alternative, such as logarithmic or quadratic. There were several
reasons for this. The primary reason is that military planning factors for personnel and
facility planning explicitly include linear formulations for requirements determination.
Personnel planning factors that define the number of personnel authorized for given
activities, such as food service, medical support, and facility maintenance, often use
linear relationships. These are formulated in the same way as the regression equation
we discussed above: cisr = asr + bsr pisr, where the fixed component, asr, is the management overhead element, and the variable component is driven by the base population.6 Likewise,
DoD facilities planning factors include linear requirements, such as an amount
of space (e.g., square feet) required per person. Second, we found that most data plots
suggest linear relationships. These data plots can be seen in Appendix A. Finally, we
tested alternative specifications for several cases. In cases where the plots did not appear
as convincingly to be linear, we tested alternative specifications. We found these alternatives
to provide no better, and in almost all cases worse, fit to the data and to produce
counterintuitive (and in some cases absurd) cost equations.
Costs of Rotational Presence
To develop a cost model for estimating the costs of rotational presence, we examined
the costs associated with the deployment of personnel and equipment, prepositioning
equipment, supporting personnel, and special compensation for deployment. We built
the model to estimate how changes in presence levels and policy options would affect
costs. Presence level is a function of rotation frequency and length, which both affect
costs in the model. Policy options include whether or not equipment is prepositioned,
and, if not, whether airlift or sealift is used to transport unit equipment. The final
cost factor is whether or not the United States has or maintains a base in the region to
which the units rotate, whether the host nation provides base support in other cases,
and whether base operating support would have to be established and provided for the
rotating unit.
Investment Costs for Restationing Forces
To determine one-time investment costs for moving forces to a new location or closing
bases, we developed an investment cost model incorporating personnel-related movement
and separation; base-related closure costs, including support contract termination,
mothball/shutdown, severance to foreign civilians, labor contract settlement costs,
and a range of one-time unique costs; and construction of new facilities to host the
units. Because of the uncertainties inherent in potential environmental cleanup costs
and in the potential gains from the residual value of facilities returned to host nations,
we excluded these costs from our assessment of investment costs. We used standard
DoD rates for the personnel-related costs, and we mined past reports to develop estimates
of base closure costs. We used regression modeling similar to that used for the
recurring-cost analysis to determine new facility requirements. In this modeling, we
determined relationships between the number of people at a base and the value of the
facilities there, again decomposing the facility value into fixed and variable costs, with
fixed costs, for example, representing facilities for which only one on a base might be
needed (e.g., commissary). 


Limitations of This Analysis
This analysis is intended to produce estimates of the impact of posture changes. It
is sufficiently accurate for cost-benefit analysis for decisionmakers to determine what
courses of action should be considered in more depth. If changes were to then be
considered as possibilities to pursue, more detailed, budget-quality cost estimates that
account for all location-, unit-, and option-specific factors would need to be done.
Preview of Cost Analysis Findings
In the course of our analysis, several costs arose as the primary drivers of incremental
differences between U.S. and overseas forces and bases. We found the largest single
driver of the incremental cost difference in variable per-person costs between the U.S.
and overseas locations to be personnel-related costs, specifically overseas allowances
and PCS moving costs. These costs comprise 60C80 percent of the incremental cost
difference in per-person costs (which ranged from around $10,000 to $40,000 per
person, depending on the service and region). Dependents’ education was next in influence,
followed by additional overseas logistics costs. These categories comprised most
of the per-person cost difference.
Unit training costs (which are captured as per-unit, not per-person costs) sometimes
drive incremental cost differences, but they do not feature as largely as per-person
costs in the impact of posture changes on costs.
Often, but not always, we found differences in the fixed-cost component of recurring
costs between U.S. and overseas locations. USAF bases appear to have systematically
higher fixed costs overseas when compared with similar U.S. bases. Two drivers
of these higher costs appear to be that these overseas bases have systematically more
facilities than bases in the United States relative to their populations and that they have
higher numbers of military personnel providing installation support. We discuss these
differences in detail in Appendix A. For all other services, the message is mixed. Many
overseas bases have fixed costs that appear to be in line or just a little higher than their
U.S. counterparts.
The more important point with regard to fixed costs is that our modeling does
suggest fixed and variable cost components to installation-support costs. Thus, if a base
is closed and the personnel are moved to an existing base, either using new facilities
built to accommodate them (with an attendant investment cost) or using any existing
underutilized facilities, then one set of fixed costs is eliminated, producing savings.
This is a benefit of consolidation, whether it was to occur overseas or in the United
States, although there is more flexibility to expand facilities and forces on U.S. bases
than overseas, since agreements may need to be worked out with the host nation. Additionally,
consolidation from overseas back to the United States produces more DoD
savings because of the higher overseas variable costs, and, in some cases, higher overseas
fixed costs. On the other hand, when overseas bases are closed, ownership reverts
to the host nation. In the United States, closed bases can be repurposed for other uses, providing economic benefit within the United States that accrues outside of DoD.
These additional potential benefits are not accounted for in this study.
In addition to recurring costs for permanently stationed forces, we also assessed
the costs associated with rotational deployments. A key finding is that rotational costs
are very dependent on the frequency and duration of deployments. For deployments to
the same region for the same unit type, higher deployment frequency combined with
lower deployment duration greatly increases costs relative to lower-frequency, longer
deployments to achieve the same degree of presence. For longer, less frequent deployments
(e.g., one unit replacing another every 12 months), personnel-related costs, such
as food, housing, and special allowances, tend to dominate the costs, driving roughly
two-thirds to three-fourths of the costs and potentially enabling some cost savings
over permanent presence. For shorter, more frequent deployments, the deployment
costs themselves―transporting personnel, equipment in some cases, and aircraft for
the USAF―tend to dominate. In these cases, equipment prepositioning, when sufficient
equipment is already available in the force, can mitigate some of those costs.
For ground forces, when the equipment is available, prepositioning offers some savings
over sealift, which also has a transit time disadvantage, with airlift extremely expensive
for ground-unit rotations with equipment due to the size and weight of units.7 For the
USAF, prepositioning can save over airlift, but because air forces have relatively little
equipment to transport, the difference is not too significant.
As a result, rotational presence is not necessarily less expensive than permanent
presence. Generally, if forces are realigned to U.S. bases but their original overseas base
stays open, the costs of even small, infrequent rotational deployments can exceed the
savings. If the sending base is closed (greatly increasing the savings), substituting full
rotational presence (12 months out of the year) for permanent presence sometimes
saves money, sometimes costs money, and sometimes roughly breaks even, depending
on the service, unit type, region, frequency and length of rotations, and equipment
policy options (transporting versus prepositioning unit equipment). In particular,
achieving extensive presence through high-frequency, short rotations would greatly
increase costs, leaving longer rotations as the only option that enables some savings
or avoidance of increased costs while maintaining high presence. If only partial, rotational
presence is substituted for permanent presence, then, depending upon the rotational
design, savings can be more substantial. In other words, we found no single,
definitive comparison for permanent versus rotational presence. Each case must be
examined individually.
Furthermore, if a base were to be closed and its forces realigned, another permanent
base in that country or region must be maintained to support the rotating forces (including considerations of facilities, space, and other accommodations) or a host
nation must agree to provide access to one of its bases. This is a potential constraint on
some posture options.
Finally, we estimate the potential investment costs necessary to shift from the
current posture to an alternative posture. The largest single driver of these costs is by
far the new construction necessary to accommodate forces relocating to the United
States. Some available capacity may exist at U.S. bases (whether today or after planned
force reductions), thus obviating the need for some portion of that new construction.
In particular, this is most likely to apply to the Army, due to significant planned force
reductions.8 So, for any illustrative options that realign Army forces from overseas to
the United States, we estimate an upper and lower bound for these costs. In our upper
bound estimate, we assume all relocating forces will require such construction. This
is the standard assumption for bases of other services. In this standard/upper-bound
estimate, new construction comprises about 85 percent of the total cost estimate for
posture changes. Thus, the lower-bound cases that would reflect the existence of available
capacity in the United States would be less, given that the need for new construction
would drop. There is more uncertainty around our estimate of investment costs
than for other elements of our cost analysis. So our investment estimates should be
considered as rough guides for the costs DoD might incur to shift its overseas posture.
Recurring Permanent Presence Cost Analysis
This section describes our methodology for determining the annual operating and
support cost difference between bases and permanently stationed forces in the United
States and those overseas, as well as for decomposing the fixed and variable cost portions
of operating and support costs to estimate the potential costs or savings that
might accrue from changes in the overseas permanent posture.9
Training Costs
The services sometimes operate their forces differently overseas than when they are
stationed in the United States. This may be as a result of partner-nation training and
exercises, constraints on U.S. activities, or a desire to generate more presence or combat capability. To capture these differences, we directly use service-provided data and
models to compute training costs for this portion of the cost analysis.
For the USAF, we used data from the Air Force Total Ownership Cost (AFTOC)
database to determine unit training costs by aircraft type and command.10 We estimated
the total training cost per aircraft per year using data from FY 2009 to FY 2011.
The results are shown in Table 8.1, which shows the average training cost per aircraft
per year for the primary aircraft currently stationed at overseas installations.11 For each
aircraft type, the left two columns show the unit operating costs at Air Combat Command
and Air Mobility Command (AMC), both located in the United States. The
right two columns show the costs for the same aircraft located in either the Pacific Air
Forces (PACAF) or USAFE. We use these costs as inputs when calculating the costs
and savings of changes to the overseas posture based on the number of aircraft moving
from one command or region to another.

<a href= "pic73.html">Table 8.1 Air Force Aircraft Annual Training Costs, by Type and Command</a><br><br>


Some costs are comparable across regions (within 5 or 10 percent), and some are
significantly higher or lower. Recent RAND research has analyzed these costs in detail
for USAFE and sheds some light on these differences. In particular, costs for depotlevel
reparables and munitions for USAFE units were generally found to be lower for fighter/attack aircraft than for their U.S. counterparts. These are believed to be lower
due to flying restrictions in Europe that reduce consumption rates for those assets.12
For the Army, we used the Force and Organization Cost Estimating System
(FORCES) Cost Model (FCM) to determine the training costs for Army units in different
regions.13 FCM uses past obligations data to produce its estimates. Table 8.2
shows select unit types and their average annual unit training costs as derived from
FCM. While FCM contains estimates for a broad range of cost elements, we included
only three in our computation of training costs: Direct Equipment Parts and Fuel Cost,
Post Production Software Support, and Indirect Support Cost. Appendix A contains
a complete list of the cost elements in FCM and how we utilize them in this report.

<a href= "pic74.html">Table 8.2 Army Unit Training Costs, by Unit Type and Region</a><br><br>

Most Army units have noticeably higher training costs in EUCOM and slightly
lower costs in PACOM. About half of the higher costs in EUCOM stem from contractual
services, and the other half of the difference is from other Indirect Support costs.
For the Navy, rotational operations are built into its structure and day-to-day
operations. The Navy has a sea/shore policy that governs the frequency and length of
deployments, and the ships rotate on regular schedules. Its force structure is designed
to provide a certain level of forces deployed on rotations at all times. While few Navy
units are actually home-ported overseas, most spend significant time overseas on deployments from U.S.-based homeports. Thus, this cost category is not as relevant
to most Navy operations for the purpose of determining the relative costs of U.S. and
overseas basing. Shore-based Navy aviation could be subject to similar regional cost
differences as their USAF counterparts, but our illustrative postures did not consider
the realignment of naval air assets, so we did not include such cost factors.
Similar unit training cost factors were not available to the RAND study team
for the Marine Corps. We therefore assume no difference in training costs of Marine
Corps units between the U.S. and overseas locations.

Allowances and PCS Costs
Several categories of allowances for military personnel are higher for overseas stations,
including the following. We used the Work Experience and monthly Active
Duty Pay files to estimate the net cost differences in allowances between CONUS
and OCONUS locations.14 This database includes the pay and allowances for all individual
service members by month. It includes their unit identifier, which we could use
to map their locations. Our use of unit identifier data is described in more depth in
the installation-related costs section. For this analysis, we used FY 2011 data to reflect
relatively recent rates for these allowances. These files include the following categories
of allowances:
 basic allowance for housing (BAH)/Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA)
 cost of living allowance (COLA), U.S. and overseas
 family separation allowance.
We first determined which personnel were in each region, separating Japan and
South Korea because of substantial differences in allowances between the two countries,
especially depending on the service. We also separately determined rates for
Marine Corps personnel stationed at Camps Pendleton and Lejuene, given the concentration
of Marine Corps stationing at these two locations and the significant allowance
differences between these two locations. Finally, we include Hawaii and Guam for reference
because of the substantial U.S. forces in the former and current plans to increase
forces at Guam and their relatively high rates. We aggregated allowances for all personnel
stationed in the selected areas to develop region-, country-, state-, territory-,
and base-specific estimates on a per-person basis. To determine per-person rates for a
location and service combination, we included only personnel that were in the location
for the full year. We excluded records where personnel were in more than one region
during the year, as they received allowances for more than one region. The results are
shown in Table 8.3. The top portion of this table shows the annual per-person cost forthe above allowances. The bottom portion of the table shows the difference between
each region and CONUS.

<a href= "pic75.html">Table 8.3 U.S. and Overseas Personnel Allowances</a><br><br>


Generally, most of the cost differences are driven by higher overseas COLA, with
OHA sometimes making a significant difference as well. One can notice the especially
small difference for the Army in Europe. The BAH paid to Army personnel is actually
much smaller in Europe than the CONUS average, which could be due to more people
living on base. For the marines in Japan, most personnel receive barracks COLA,
which is much less than standard COLA, and very few receive OHA, limiting the difference for marines in Japan versus CONUS. That difference is even smaller when
comparing Japan with Camp Pendleton, which is an area with relatively high BAH.15
Additionally, overseas PCS costs are higher than for PCS moves within CONUS.
PCS move costs are incurred any time a service member must move, whether for
normal duties; schooling; overseas assignments; or, in some cases, separation. Moves
between CONUS and OCONUS (referred to as transoceanic travel) cost more than
those within CONUS, so OCONUS positions incur that additional cost.16 These
occur as a single movement of one service member (and his or her family and household
belongings) from one station to another. Additionally, OCONUS assignments
tend to be shorter, increasing the number of moves per assigned person, magnifying
the effect of the higher costs per PCS move.
To derive PCS move costs, we looked to each service’s budget estimate, which list
the total expenditures for PCS move, called PCS travel, which is divided into several
categories.17 Operational travel includes moves to and from permanent-duty stations
located within the United States or within another country or region involving no
transoceanic travel. Training travel includes moves to and from permanent-duty stations
located within CONUS to service or civilian schools. Rotational travel includes
moves from permanent-duty stations in CONUS to permanent-duty stations overseas,
and vice versa, as well movements among overseas regions involving transoceanic
travel. For accessions and separation travel, which include travel to and from first and
last duty station, respectively, regardless of whether in CONUS or OCONUS, we
allocated portions of each to CONUS and OCONUS categories based on the relative
proportions of assigned personnel to each for the respective service. We used FY 2011
costs, because they reflect actual spending, not estimates of spending, and were the
most recent such actuals available at the time of this study. 


Because our aim is to calculate the total cost per person to be stationed in a particular
region, we divide the total PCS move spending in each category by the total
permanently stationed personnel in the corresponding region. Thus OCONUS PCS
costs in our modeling include rotational travel and OCONUS shares of accessions and
separation travel. The CONUS PCS costs in our modeling include operational travel,
training travel, and CONUS shares of accessions and separation travel. To determine
CONUS permanently assigned, we subtracted the number of people in service TTHS
accounts from the number of people we counted in CONUS from the DMDC data.
The results of our calculations are shown in Table 8.4.
The top half of Table 8.4 shows CONUS costs, OCONUS costs, and the differences
between the two. We show the total cost of PCS moves in each category, the
total personnel in the corresponding region(s), and the calculated cost per person. This
is not a cost per PCS move, but an effective cost per person for PCS costs, reflecting
both moves per assigned person and cost per move.
The cost per move does not show as much of a difference between CONUS
and OCONUS. For example, when all of the PCS travel categories are included, for
the Army, our estimate produces $5,700 per CONUS PCS move and $11,300 per
OCONUS PCS move, so that the OCONUS cost per move is about $5,600 more
than for CONUS. But PCS moves between CONUS and OCONUS occur more frequently than those within CONUS, so the cost differences are exacerbated. For
the Army, the OCONUS cost per person is about $6,800 higher than the same for
CONUS.
In the bottom half of Table 8.4, we show the number of moves by region our
method estimated based on the various PCS travel categories included and how they
were apportioned and how that converts into moves per person per year, reflecting two
moves per assignment change.

Installation-Related Costs
Installation Base Operating Support Costs
In the introduction to this chapter, we explained our basic approach using regression
analysis. We now explain this in more detail. Figure 8.1 shows a notional mathematical
model of installation-support costs as they relate to the size of the military presence
on that installation. The size of forces or the number of personnel (who drive support
costs) is on the x-axis, while support costs are shown on the y-axis. As the number of
personnel requiring support on a base increases, so do support costs. These costs can be
broken down into fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are those that are independent of
an activity or output level, while variable costs are costs that change in proportion to an
activity or output. In other words, variable costs can be assigned to specific operational
activities and scale with the level of that activity. Fixed costs can be seen as overhead, or
costs that cannot be directly assigned in relation to the level of an activity. The variable
cost component (the slope of the line) corresponds to the size of a force at a location,
with potentially different variable cost relationships depending on location and force
type; the fixed-cost component (the y-intercept of the line) corresponds to the cost of a base in a given region, potentially varying by base type. A single installation would
occupy a single point on the blue line.

<a href= "pic77.html">Figure 8.1 Installation-Support Costs Have Fixed and Variable Cost Components</a><br><br>


In particular, “variable cost (move forces)” is meant to alert the reader that if the
installation stayed open but forces were moved from it, then the variable cost would
decrease at the installation but the fixed cost would remain unchanged. The variable
cost would increase at the receiving installation. Thus, there is a variable cost savings
only if there is a difference between the two installations. “Fixed cost (close bases)”
means that the annual fixed-cost portion of the installation―again not all of the costs
associated with the installation―would be saved if the installation were closed and the
forces inactivated or moved to an existing installation. Since some posture questions
may involve partial realignment of forces from and installation, it is important to have
a model that can disentangle the fixed versus variable costs and how the latter vary
with changes in base population.
We explain this further using installation-support cost data plotted in Figure 8.2.
This plot shows data for the Army using a subset of the installations we analyzed to
explain the concepts. We include complete sets of our raw data in Appendix A with
detailed explanations.

<a href= "pic78.html">Figure 8.2 Example Data Plot of Army Installation-Support Costs to Illustrate the Need for Cost Modeling</a><br><br>


On this plot, the x-axis shows the base population of Army bases, and the y-axis
shows the annual spending on installations support ($ millions, average FYs 2009C
2011). Each icon is a single location. Blue dots show a subset of U.S. bases (those with
permanently stationed operational forces, e.g., Ft. Bragg, Ft. Bliss), and red triangles  show EUCOM Army bases with forces (e.g., Vicenza). We can see several things from
this plot.
First, for U.S. bases, costs visually correlate with base population, as reflected in
the purple line. From these data, then, one can derive a relationship between the size of
a force at a base and the support costs―a cost per person. We did a simple regression
analysis on these data points (excluding the two points in the middle oval, which we
discuss below). The line defined by the resulting regression equation is the thick purple
line, and the resulting cost per person is about $5,200 per person. This means that, all
other things being equal, reducing the military population of one of those bases would
reduce the net installation-support costs at those bases by about $5,200 per person per
year. This amount would be saved only if the forces were eliminated from the force
structure. Some savings would accrue if they were transferred to other bases with lower
variable costs per person.
We also note that the two blue dots near the top of the plot, in the middle oval,
are far above the other points. From left to right, these two bases are Schofield Barracks,
Hawaii, and Fort Benning, Georgia. There are potential reasons why these bases
have significantly higher costs than other U.S. bases with operational forces. For example,
the costs of goods and services are much higher in Hawaii than elsewhere in the
United States, and, while Ft. Benning does host some operational forces, a large portion
of the personnel and activity there are focused on training, because it hosts the
Army’s Maneuver Center of Excellence with the Infantry and Armor schools. But it
is not necessary to explore every possibility. We can say that these two bases are not
representative of the general pattern the rest of the bases demonstrate, but for specific
reasons.
Third, the regression does not intersect the y-axis at zero, but rather does so at
about $95 million. This means that if military personnel relocate from one base, and
that base’s cost moved along the regression line, when all military personnel left the
base, theoretically there would still be $95 million in installation-support costs. These
costs could include security, engineering for facilities, various contracting costs to sustain
the base, and a host of services for those people still providing services. This is a
theoretical scenario, but that fixed-cost component (the y-intercept) provides a way to
estimate the costs that would be reduced at one installation and increased at another
installation if a portion of the military personnel were simply moved from one base to
another, and how much of the costs remain at the sending installation given it lost only
a portion of its personnel. In reality, costs would change at some point before reaching
zero or some other very low number, but we are interested only in the range of base
populations that are typically used, and we use the fixed cost to estimate the amount
of cost that is invariant to population within the range of observed base populations.
Those personnel moving would take with them their associated variable costs, which
could change, depending on the variable cost rate at the receiving base, and leave the fixed costs. The fixed cost also represents the opportunity for savings from closure of a
base and consolidation of forces at other bases.
Next, even though our regression analysis has estimated the fixed and variable
parameters with a standard, accepted level of statistical confidence, it does not
perfectly explain the costs of every data point. Our statistical outputs tell us that this
regression model (the combination of fixed and variable parameter estimates) explains
about 79 percent of the variation in installation-support costs based on the number of
military personnel on a base. The dots in the oval to the right show that even two bases
with virtually identical numbers of military personnel can have significantly different
installation-support costs. There is some natural variation inherent in systems like this,
but there could also be knowable specific local attributes that could explain some of
that variation. However, in this study we have not attempted to determine all of the
specific local factors that would cause all of the variation, and it may not even be possible
to do so. Regardless, the model is a generalization to quickly estimate the effects
of changes and will rarely predict any single data point perfectly, but should predict
costs well enough to determine whether an option is worth further consideration. If an
option appears promising to pursue given all considerations―estimated costs, risks,
and benefits―then one would need to determine the exact costs at the specific bases
under consideration to finalize the decision. But the model should produce reasonable
estimates for comparing potential courses of action to consider.
Next, we highlight the EUCOM bases, the red triangles in Figure 8.2. It appears
that four of the five EUCOM bases fall more or less in the range of the U.S. bases.
At the same time, there is an extreme outlier, which is circled. This is Grafenwoehr,
Germany. Again, there are good reasons, similar to those for Ft. Benning, why this is
the case, given the significant training facilities located at Grafenwoehr, which incur
costs to train transient populations. There are too few data points to perform a separate
regression analysis on EUCOM bases alone, and any generalization should be
approached with caution. It does appear that the four EUCOM bases in the range of
U.S. bases in fact have similar cost relationships, and that Grafenwoehr is an outlier
with installation-support costs not explained by military personnel alone. We can say
that from these data, there is not enough evidence to show that, in general, EUCOM
bases have higher or lower fixed or variable costs for installation support than U.S.
bases.
Finally, we have plotted the regression lines that would result from analyzing
these U.S. and EUCOM bases separately and forcing the y-intercept through the
origin. These results are shown by the thin lines. The purpose of this is to demonstrate
the result of taking the simple average costs per person of these two data sets, instead
of trying to estimate fixed versus variable costs. To simply divide the total support costs
by the total military personnel in these two data sets would result in per person costs
of about $9,000 per person for U.S. bases and $42,000 per person for EUCOM bases.
(Here, Grafenwoehr does not significantly change the regression line.) 

Aside from problems with statistical fit or significance, this approach creates two
problems. First, it misrepresents the cost dynamics at Army bases. We know that there
are fixed costs (i.e., overhead) built in to some military planning factors―and virtually
all facilities and organizations―and the data support this. To use a simple average is
to overstate per-person costs, potentially overstating savings from realigning personnel,
and would not identify those costs that would likely only be saved if the base were
closed.18
The second shortcoming is that this approach (that of taking a simple average
cost per person) actually makes overseas locations appear relatively more expensive
than U.S. bases when they may not actually be so. This is because for most of the services,
overseas bases have smaller base populations than those in the United States.
(This can be seen in the data plots in Appendix A.) If we include the four clustered
EUCOM data points with the U.S. data points in Figure 8.2, it does not significantly
change the regression results compared with the U.S. baseConly regression. However,
because EUCOM bases are smaller and therefore closer to the origin than U.S. bases,
the slope of the regression line if using only these four bases and if forced through the
origin is much steeper, implying higher per-person costs. It may be that EUCOM bases
do have higher per-person installation-support costs, and that the difference between
EUCOM and U.S. bases would be saved were units relocated to the United States from
EUCOM. But from the data shown in Figure 8.2, the case is not convincing. In short,
the EUCOM bases are smaller, have a higher proportion of their installation-support
costs in fixed costs than U.S. bases with likely similar variable costs per-person, and
have relatively similar fixed costs per base. This can be thought of as akin to spreading
the overhead across a larger population.
This does not mean that there are no cost differences between U.S. and overseas
bases. Installation-support costs are only one of the components we analyze, and we do
find significant incremental overseas costs in other areas.
For all the reasons above, when possible, we develop regression-based models to
explain the relative costs of overseas posture. Given the discussion above, one can also
see that the case is not always clear-cut. As we proceed with our analysis, we do so
cautiously, explaining our assumptions clearly, so the reader can understand when we
utilized our own analytic judgment in ways that influence the results. In addition, we tabulate and graph each data set we use, display the results of each regression analysis,
and explain our findings in detail in Appendix A.
Our overall analytic approach for installation support is shown in Figure 8.3.
In the first two steps, on the left, we compiled data on cost and personnel from various
sources. We built cost and personnel databases based on raw data inputs from the
services and defense agencies. We then integrated these data, matching cost and personnel
figures at the installation level. Next, we analyzed these data, applying various
methods to produce cost factors. We then assembled these cost factors into a single cost
model that we then applied to each of our illustrative postures to estimate their cost
effects. In the succeeding sections, we explain each of these steps in more detail.
<a href= "pic79.html">Figure 8.3 Installation-Support Cost Analytic Approach</a><br><br>

Compile Cost Data
We obtained detailed installation-support cost data from each of the services in the
form of obligations for FYs 2009C2011.19 Because the data were from different sources,
we first compared the data across the services to ensure that we included comparable
categories. DoD organizes its spending around programs and designates them with
codes called program elements (PEs), the smallest resource aggregation controlled by
the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). OSD provides a set of PEs to the services
to track installation-support costs, and the data we received contained costs binned by
PE and installation, so we could make comparisons of the installation-support cost
data across the services’ disparate systems. Table 8.5 shows the common PE categories
across the services from their installation-support cost data.



<a href= "pic80.html">Table 8.5 Installation-Support Cost Data Program Element Categories</a><br><br>


These PEs form the baseline comparison for all services. We also sought to eliminate
any service-specific differences in funding categories or funding not directly related
to the day-to-day support of a service’s activities on a particular installation. Thus, we
excluded overseas contingency operations (OCO) funding, reimbursable costs (e.g., a
tenant unit paying another service for installation support), and transportation working
capital fund spending from our analysis.
Several other PE categories not common to all four services were provided by the
respective services. The Air Force uses some military personnel for installation support
and tracks them in a category called Combat Support. We believe these costs should be
included in any estimate of the full cost DoD bears for installation support, and thus
we include them in our cost models and calculations. This is explained in more detail
in Appendix A, which explores different assumptions regarding the costs to include for
Air Force bases. The Navy is the only service that provided a category for Port Operations,
which we included for the Navy. We treat medical costs in a separate section.
Table 8.6 shows the number of bases and annual installation-support costs by
service and region, including the United States, EUCOM, and PACOM. Cost numbers are average values for FYs 2009C2011. We used multiple years of data to smooth
out the impacts of events unique to a given year for a base. For these data, we excluded
most U.S. territories, and considered only Guam and bases on foreign soil for inclusion
in PACOM. The purpose of this was to create data sets from which we could estimate
regional cost differences, and traditional definitions of some COCOM AORs include
a mix of U.S. soil, U.S. territories, and foreign soil. We differentiated among these to
keep cost categories clear.20
Compile Personnel Data
Our second step was to analyze personnel data. We obtained personnel data from
DMDC.21 The 2012 posture tables in Chapter One summarize these personnel data,
with totals for each major installation (permanently assigned personnel only). In addition
to raw personnel numbers, an important element in these data is the unit, specified
by the unit identification code (UIC). A UIC is a unique identifier assigned to a
unit or organization in DoD. Table 8.7 summarizes the personnel data we obtained. It
shows the total number of locations and UICs worldwide in the DMDC data, by service,
for locations with greater than 100 active duty personnel. These UICs are important
to our analysis because of our approach to analyzing the personnel and cost data.
Forces stationed at an installation demand base services, and this drives support costs.
However, not all personnel on base demand the same level of support, and some personnel
are providing those base services. We therefore introduce a classification system
to categorize military activities on an installation to inform our analysis.
For the purposes of our analysis, we classified all military units (by UIC) in one
of three broad categories based on whether (and how) they drive installation support or
provide it. These categories are mutually exclusive and completely exhaustive.


<a href= "pic81.html">Table 8.7 UIC Data Summary</a><br><br>

Referring back to Figure 8.1, we classified two types of activities as drivers of
installation-support costs, i.e., as independent variables: operational and institutional
forces. Within operational forces, we include both deployable forces―e.g., fighter
wings, BCTs, battalion landing teams, and carrier groups―and nondeployable operational
forces such as space, missile, and cyber forces that have ongoing operational
missions but employ them from home-station. One way to encapsulate operational
forces is to ask whether these units or activities are directly employed by COCOMs for
operations, whether from the U.S. or foreign soil.
The second subclass of installation-support drivers we call institutional. Institutional
activities are those that sustain the organization as a whole (including the
needs of the operational forces―other than installation support) but do not themselves
directly execute operational missions assigned to COCOMs. Examples of institutional
forces are support activities such as recruitment, training, and supply chain management.
These activities are generally found in commands managing materiel (e.g., Army
and USAF material commands), executing training, and conducting R&D, along with
entities such as service headquarters.
These operational and institutional activities must be performed somewhere, and
they incur costs wherever they are located. Thus, these two activities drive installationsupport
costs (often called base operating support), our dependent variable. Installation
support includes all the facilities, equipment, and personnel needed to run the
installation where those operational and institutional units and activities are located:
to feed, protect, provide medical support to, and otherwise service the population,
whatever task that population performs on a day-to-day basis. Their purpose is essentially
directed at supporting other units and activities on the installation. In general, the
location of institutional forces is not determined by the size and shape of operational
forces on that base. So, at base level, operational and institutional forces are independently
located and do not, on the whole, affect one another on a given base. We treat
operational and institutional activities separately, even though they are both drivers, or
demanders, of base support, because they place different types of demands on installation
support with different cost implications.22 We applied this framework to the personnel
data to derive cost relationships for base support. We assigned all UICs to one
of those three categories.
We now walk through a couple of examples of how we classified UICs at different
bases (see Table 8.8). The first set is from Ramstein Air Base, in Germany. The
UICs are all for Air Force units. The first UIC is for the 37th Airlift Squadron, which
operates C-130Js to conduct airlift, airdrop, and aeromedical evacuation operations.
The second unit shown is an element of the USAFE headquarters, which we classify as
institutional. The third unit there, the 86th Mission Support Group, provides installation support to Ramstein, including mission support, communications, security, and
base services.

<a href= "pic82.html">Table 8.8 Example UIC Classification</a><br><br>


The second base is an example from the Army: Fort Bragg. The first UIC is for
the 1st Battalion, 319th Field Artillery Regiment, which we classify as operational. The
second unit shown is Headquarters of the Army Forces Command, which we classify
as institutional. The third unit is the U.S. Army Garrison, Fort Bragg. This unit, composed
mostly of civilians, provides installation support at Fort Bragg.
We used this approach to classify the over 38,000 UICs from the DMDC data.
To do so, we drew on service documentation about the structure of UICs and information
contained in the UIC data (such as the title and composition). We produced a
single data set with all personnel and UIC classifications for all four services, for U.S.
and overseas locations. We note here that we exclude personnel from one service living
at the base of another service, as well as their support costs.23 This data set fed the next
step of our analysis. 


Integrate Personnel and Cost Data
The third step in our analysis was to integrate the cost and personnel data. This essentially
amounted to matching the cost and personnel data for the same installations,
across services and regions. We were left with very few mismatches between the data
sources.
Analyze Personnel and Cost Data
The fourth step in our approach was to analyze the personnel and cost data and create
the installation-support cost model. To do so, we performed several least-squares
regression analyses to isolate the fixed and variable components of installation support.
In addition to the general relationships between military forces and support costs,
we sought to differentiate among the services and regions to the degree possible. This
entailed modeling each service separately (i.e., conducting separate regression analyses
on each) and creating variables to differentiate among regions and types of bases.24
For our mathematical models, we sought to capture the basic dynamics of each
subset (e.g., region/service). We thus excluded bases that were far outside the range of
typical values.25 An example of this is that some Air Force training bases in the United
States have significant training facilities that bring with them additional costs out
of proportion with the aircraft and personnel located there, relative to bases without
training operations.26 In general, when separating classes of installations, we filtered to
develop sets that had viable analogs from set to set (e.g., we excluded large depot maintenance
facilities, because they do not have analogs in overseas locations).
We focused on two primary dependent variables: total installation-support costs
and numbers of support personnel. We iteratively tested a range of models that specified
different independent and control variables to identify the primary drivers and
best predictors of support costs. We used statistical fit methods to determine the best
regression models.27 Table 8.9 summarizes the results of the regression analysis, with the top section of the table showing the fixed costs in millions of dollars per base by
service and region and the bottom section showing the additional variable costs in
thousands of dollars per person. We use the values shown in Table 8.9 in our cost
models to assess comprehensive posture options. In cases where bases are outliers in
terms of cost versus personnel, we treat them separately rather than using these generalized
values to develop posture cost estimates. We discuss these exceptions in more
detail in Appendix A.
The top row of the upper table in Table 8.9 shows the estimated fixed cost for
installations on U.S. soil.28 These figures represent the net annual installation-support
costs that would be estimated to be saved were that service to close an installation (notwithstanding
any investments made to close the base). The fixed-cost components for
U.S. bases are similar across the services.
The next two rows show the estimated fixed costs for EUCOM bases, both without
and with operational forces. This differentiation, between bases with or without
operational forces, only mattered for Air Force and Navy bases in our regression analyses.
The Air Force, for example, occupies some small installations in the UK with units
(e.g., communications) but no aircraft. The regression analysis showed these smaller
installations to have significantly lower fixed costs than those with fully functioning
airfields and flying units. The Navy installations showed similar differentiation between those with and without operational forces, while that designation did not
make a significant difference for costs at Army and Marine Corps locations (cells with
“C” for not applicable).29
In general, we found little difference in the fixed-cost component between U.S.
and overseas bases (comparing the first, third, and fifth rows). The Marine Corps and
Army are statistically indistinguishable between the U.S. and overseas, and the Navy’s
fixed installation-support costs are estimated to be slightly higher overseas. In effect,
this means that overseas bases with base populations similar to those in the United
States had installation-support costs that were also similar. For the Navy, our regression
model was not able to differentiate between EUCOM and PACOM with statistical
significance, but was able to differentiate them from the United States when grouped
together, which is why the table shows the same values for EUCOM and PACOM.
The Air Force installation-support fixed cost estimate is significantly higher for
overseas bases for several reasons. First, overseas Air Force installations appear to have
significantly more facilities (higher number and more square footage) than their U.S.
counterparts with similar base populations. These facilities drive operations, sustainment,
and other costs. In addition, overseas Air Force bases have a significantly higher
number of military personnel providing installation support than do U.S. bases of
similar size. These additional support personnel in turn require more on-base services,
and they incur additional overseas allowances and PCS costs. The difference between
EUCOM and PACOM Air Force installations is driven by slightly different proportions
of military personnel providing installation support.
The fact that our analysis did isolate a fixed-cost component for installation support
is quite important. Having a fixed cost for an installation presents an opportunity
for efficiency through consolidation or concentration, regardless of whether installations
are in the United States or overseas. If a base is closed and its forces moved to
existing bases, the recurring fixed costs of the closed bases become recurring savings
(even if one-time investment costs for new facilities are required). If, instead, moving a
force from one region to another requires opening a new base, then the savings or cost
increase would be the fixed cost differential for similar base types in the two regions.
When we apply these numbers to develop estimates of the cost effects of changes in
posture, the fixed component would be saved were a base in that region closed and altogether
vacated. Again, note that is not the total installation-support cost for the base,
just the fixed cost portion.
The bottom table in Table 8.9 shows the variable cost per person, in thousands
of dollars, for installation support. The values shown in this table are for the variable
costs per person for operational personnel only, following the categories we described  the top section of the table showing the fixed costs in millions of dollars per base by
service and region and the bottom section showing the additional variable costs in
thousands of dollars per person. We use the values shown in Table 8.9 in our cost
models to assess comprehensive posture options. In cases where bases are outliers in
terms of cost versus personnel, we treat them separately rather than using these generalized
values to develop posture cost estimates. We discuss these exceptions in more
detail in Appendix A.

The top row of the upper table in Table 8.9 shows the estimated fixed cost for
installations on U.S. soil.28 These figures represent the net annual installation-support

U.S. bases are similar across the services.

The Air Force installation-support fixed cost estimate is significantly higher for
overseas bases for several reasons. First, overseas Air Force installations appear to have
significantly more facilities (higher number and more square footage) than their U.S.
counterparts with similar base populations. These facilities drive operations, sustainment,
and other costs. In addition, overseas Air Force bases have a significantly higher
number of military personnel providing installation support than do U.S. bases of
similar size. These additional support personnel in turn require more on-base services,
and they incur additional overseas allowances and PCS costs. The difference between
EUCOM and PACOM Air Force installations is driven by slightly different proportions
of military personnel providing installation support.
The fact that our analysis did isolate a fixed-cost component for installation support
is quite important. Having a fixed cost for an installation presents an opportunity
for efficiency through consolidation or concentration, regardless of whether installations
are in the United States or overseas. If a base is closed and its forces moved to

When we apply these numbers to develop estimates of the cost effects of changes in
posture, the fixed component would be saved were a base in that region closed and altogether
vacated. Again, note that is not the total installation-support cost for the base,
just the fixed cost portion.
The bottom table in Table 8.9 shows the variable cost per person, in thousands
of dollars, for installation support. The values shown in this table are for the variable
costs per person for operational personnel only, following the categories we described earlier―operational, institutional, and support. Operational personnel are those that
populate the operational units that our posture options consider relocating.30
Notice that the installation-support variable costs do not differ by region. This
means that for the installation-support cost data provided to us, the variable costs
associated with installation support were not measurably different when comparing
overseas to U.S. installations. The variable costs per person are roughly comparable
for the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, but are significantly higher for the USAF.
We show only the parameter estimates, but each one has an associated error (shown in
Appendix A), so some of these estimates could be closer to one another. These results
include the pay for USAF military personnel providing installation support, which
greatly increases the overall support costs for the Air Force. If one excludes the PE category
with that military pay, the Air Force installation-support variable cost decreases
to about $8,300 per person, which is comparable to the other services.31
The fact that the USAF chooses to provide a significant portion of its installation
support with military personnel is a policy choice that has costs and benefits.
These military personnel receive experience directly relevant to many wartime tasks on
an everyday basis. In addition, using military personnel for installation support who
will then deploy in wartime arguably saves money over a policy that provides installation
support solely with civilians and contractors and requires a completely separate
military population for warfighting. There are disadvantages of this policy choice
from a force management perspective, but the net results relevant to this discussion
are two. First, this use of military personnel makes USAF installation-support costs,
when viewed in isolation, appear to be more expensive than the other services’. Second,
and more important, because these military personnel offset some number of civilians
who would be doing those jobs and the military personnel would still be needed for
wartime missions, arguably the total costs of the USAF providing its total inventory of
capabilities is lower.32
In contrast to the fixed-cost component for bases, our calculations of cost differences
for personnel use only the difference between U.S. and overseas installations (i.e.,
the difference between the variable cost of personnel in the United States and the variable cost of personnel overseas). In a posture option, if a unit, say a fighter squadron,
were moved from PACOM to the United States, installation support would have to be
provided there, too. Because the rate (the variable cost) is the same, there would be no
net cost savings on just the installation support. That is, unlike for fixed costs where
absolute levels matter for estimating the cost effects of posture changes, for variable
costs only the relative costs among regions matter.
It is generally believed that overseas bases do cost more to operate than those
in the United States. Indeed, the two previous sections showed that for training and
personnel-related variable costs, along with installation-support fixed costs in some
cases, there is a premium to be paid for stationing forces overseas. Recall that this section
analyzed only operating and sustainment installation-support costs as accounted
for in service accounting data. One explanation for the lack of differentiation in variable
installation-support costs among regions could be that host-nation contributions
to installation-support costs, as discussed in Chapter Seven, may suppress the “real”
cost of basing overseas. HNS may contribute enough to “level the playing field,” thus
making overseas installation-support variable costs indistinguishable from those in the
United States. Recall that the costs we show in this section are net of HNS, showing
the actual costs to DoD after HNS is accounted for. We discuss these regression analyses
and results in greater detail in Appendix A.
Medical Service Costs
While medical services are provided at installations, we separate the costs from installation
support for our analysis. We obtained detailed medical-support cost data from
the Air Force and Navy, and more aggregated data from the Army. In addition, the
Army FCM contains cost factors for Defense Health Program operating costs. The net
result of our analysis of medical cost data is that medical costs do not appear to be significantly
different between U.S. and overseas locations, so we exclude them from our
analysis and cost models.33
Construction Costs to Recapitalize Infrastructure
The majority of DoD installation-support costs go to supporting the many facilities on
bases. DoD defines three categories of facility support. Operations refers to day-to-day
operational expenses, e.g., utilities, service contracts. Sustainment refers to the maintenance
and repair activities on real property that are necessary to keep facilities in good
working order. Recapitalization refers to major renovation or reconstruction activities
(including replacement facility construction) needed to modernize facilities and prevent
obsolescence.34 For the purposes of this discussion, when we use the term facility recapitalization, we mean the complete replacement of a facility―at a comparable level
of capability―that has reached the end of its serviceable life.
We seek to capture the full range of these recurring costs to DoD, but these definitions
of facility support activities do not align precisely with accounting data. The
spending data we obtained from each of the services includes operations and maintenance
spending, and covers facilities operations, sustainment, and non-MILCON
restoration and modernization. To calculate the sum of DoD spending on the range
of facility support activities, one could add to that the spending from the MILCON
appropriation.
However, MILCON expenditure data would be problematic to use to estimate
recurring construction costs for recapitalization, for several reasons. Only one application
of MILCON spending is simply to replace aging facilities―recapitalization―
that have reached the end of their serviceable lives. Given no changes in mission (e.g.,
introduction of a new weapon system) or size of the force, these expenses would be
relatively constant over a long enough time period. It is important for us to include
these in the recurring costs of maintaining military presence. However, MILCON is
performed on a project basis, and a range of factors drive which projects are planned
and performed from year to year; it is not steady based on a long-term annual requirement.
These factors include, but are not limited to, availability of funding, criticality of
need (e.g., mission needs, facility conditions), the step or periodic function of conduction
recapitalization of a building rather than the same amount every year, and political
considerations.
Beyond the replacement of facilities, changes in mission or activities at a base
drive MILCON. New weapon systems drive the need for different kinds of facilities
or simply additional ones. These are introduced irregularly, and thus create spikes in
construction activity. Also, DoD has reduced its forces and consolidated installations
since the end of the Cold War. Both of these trends, sometimes operating independently
of each other, also affect the total demand for and funding for MILCON from
year to year, as BRAC and other restationing often require investments at installations
at which consolidation is occurring.
Finally, while MILCON spending is proposed and funded on the basis of specific
projects at named locations, actual MILCON data do not make completely clear
exactly which projects occurred at which locations. As discussed in Chapter Six, we
could not assign the totality of the MILCON estimates to particular locations. Without
doing so, we cannot confidently use installation-level MILCON spending data to
estimate the relative cost differences among regions. Thus, it is not possible to develop
cost models of the sort―based on actual spending at the installation level―in which
we are interested.
Considering all these factors, actual MILCON expenditures are not a reliable
source from which to develop cost models to predict, based on a (potentially small)
shift in the overseas posture, what the net effect on MILCON would be. Analysis of MILCON data shows large increases and decreases in spending from year to year,
many of which cannot be definitively explained by the factors listed above, or associated
cleanly with recurring facility recapitalization costs.
Nonetheless, for completeness, we need to estimate the recurring costs of maintaining
DoD’s inventory of buildings in an operational status. Rather than using
MILCON, we instead chose to model these costs by estimating the total dollar value
of DoD facilities and incorporating a periodic recapitalization rate. This leads to what
is termed a requirements model. The main advantage of this approach is that it avoids
the variations in spending described above. There are potential disadvantages. First,
as described in Chapter Seven, host nations often share a substantial cost burden for
DoD’s overseas installations. Some of these contributions go to construction, whether
directly or indirectly. The United States does not currently bear the full cost burden of
construction costs at some of its foreign installations. In that sense, a pure PRV-based
cost estimate may overestimate the effective cost burden for facility recapitalization.
We discuss below how we seek to control for this factor. Second, the requirement is
not always executed based on the factors listed previously. Nevertheless, given the challenges
associated with the alternative, we believe the benefits of our approach outweigh
the costs.
To perform the analysis, we used the RPAD described in Chapter Six. First, we
tallied the PRV of facilities at DoD installations, categorized by service and region. We
excluded from our calculations all closed or disposed facilities, all land-only infrastructure,
and all Guard- or Reserve-only installations. Table 8.10 summarizes these data.
Table 8.10 shows the total number of unique installations and the total associated
PRV for each service and region. We matched these installations and their PRV values
to the personnel data described above. Similar to our installation-support cost analysis,
we performed a least-squares regression analysis to determine the fixed PRV per installation
and the variable PRV per person by service and region. We used total military
and civilian personnel as the independent variable and the PRV for each installation as
the dependent variable. To then estimate the amount of annual MILCON necessary
to recapitalize these facility levels, we used a recapitalization rate. Given a life span for  facilities, we can estimate what fraction of the inventory of facilities would, on average,
need to be recapitalized each year. We used a 67-year factor recapitalization rate drawn
from a 2002 DoD analysis on the topic.35 This means that 1/67th of the total value of
facilities on each installation would need to be replaced per year. One can think of this
as an upper bound estimate of potential recapitalization spending, i.e., a requirement.


<a href= "pic84.html">Table 8.10 RPAD PRV Data Summary</a><br><br>

There are several factors that would affect actual levels of spending. First, HNS
offsets a substantial portion of the DoD’s cost burden, including for facility construction.
HNS would likely reduce the actual recapitalization cost burden on the DoD,
but because of the difficulty inherent in fully parsing all HNS contributions, we are
unable to estimate exactly how much of this total requirement would be offset by
HNS. Second, the services can simply choose to defer recapitalization beyond the
67-year policy, accepting the risks and impacts of deteriorating facilities.36 Third, it
is generally believed that restoration and modernization impacts recapitalization such
that maintaining facilities at too low a level can shorten their serviceable lives. The
services could choose to take that risk, and if this belief is true, this would cause facilities
to need to be replaced earlier than policy would suggest, which would make our
estimates too low.
Considering these caveats, this method is a replicable way to produce a rough
estimate of recapitalization requirements. Later, we discuss a method to adjust our estimates
to better estimate likely spending, but first we show the results of our regression
analysis. Table 8.11 summarizes the results of the PRV regression analysis.
Table 8.11 shares the same format as the one in the previous section for installationsupport
costs. The top section shows values for the fixed PRV component per base; the
bottom section shows values for the variable PRV component (again, this is PRV per
person, not recapitalization cost per person). We divide these PRVs by 67 to approximate
the annual recapitalization requirements for each category.

<a href= "pic85.html">Table 8.11 Regression Results for PRV Data Analysis</a><br><br>


In some cases, overseas bases show a significant difference in fixed cost per base
when compared to U.S. bases. Air Force installations overseas have a fixed-cost component
about twice as high for overseas installations than for the United States. To
achieve statistical significance with this small sample size, we combined EUCOM and
PACOM into one overseas estimate. This does not mean that their PRVs or costs would
be exactly the same, but we use this as a general factor.


For the Army, most overseas bases’ PRVs are in the range of comparably sized
U.S. bases. The exceptions to this are Grafenwoehr and Kaiserslautern. These are outliers
relative to U.S. bases. This is consistent with the findings from our installationsupport
cost section, where those two bases were also outliers.37 It is likely that the
activities they support, training and central logistics for USAREUR, respectively, drive
both high installation-support costs and PRV relative to their assigned populations,
with the higher PRV in turn also magnifying the support costs.
For the Marine Corps, the only significant permanent overseas presence is in
Japan, and most of that is on Okinawa. The results for PRV are driven by the Camp
Butler Complex. PRV relative to assigned personnel for Iwakuni is in line with comparable
U.S. bases. For Camp Butler, the PRV is an outlier relative to U.S. bases given
its population (this includes, as does the estimate for PRV in Table 8.11, the 5,600 personnel
on Unit Deployment Program [UDP]38 rotations to Okinawa in the total base
population), but roughly half the additional PRV for Camp Butler can be attributed to
its relatively high area cost factor relative to the United States. We estimated the difference
between Camp Butler and the U.S. predicted value from our regression model as
described in Appendix A. The illustrative posture options described in Chapter Nine do not include the closure of Camp Butler, so the fixed MILCON recapitalization estimate
derived from the fixed PRV does not affect the posture cost results. Additionally,
HNS compensates for a portion of the MILCON requirement in Japan, as discussed
in Chapter Seven and later in this section.
The Navy had more data points for the regression analysis, but the two data
sets―U.S. and overseas locations―simply exhibited similar cost relationships. Thus,
we assign them the same fixed-cost component. Guam, like Camp Butler, was an
extreme outlier, and we treat this separately from other overseas locations. We did not
include the closure of Guam in our illustrative posture options, so again the fixed cost
itself does not drive our cost results.
Some of the higher PRVs can be explained by higher area cost factors (ACFs) for
the countries and territories where the United States has forces. The PRVs incorporate
these ACFs. Japan, Italy, Germany, and Guam have significantly higher ACFs than
CONUS, while the UK and South Korea have only slightly higher values. In nearly
every case where a base has a higher PRV than comparably sized U.S. bases, it is in a
country with significantly higher ACFs. In most of the cases where an overseas base is
located in a country where the ACFs are more in line with the U.S. average (e.g., South
Korea and the UK), the PRVs were, too.39 In any case, it is this annual fixed cost of
MILCON for recapitalization that would be saved were a particular installation closed.
The bottom section of Table 8.11 shows the variable costs per person. In all cases,
overseas bases were either extreme outliers (preventing detailed comparison of variable
costs) or were well in line with U.S. bases. From this we conclude that the variable cost
components are similar for analogous cases, and we use the same factor for all regions.
The net result of this is that for per-person costs, MILCON for recapitalization does
not factor into our estimates of the relative costs of different postures. The total variable
PRV will factor into one-time investment costs, though, which we discuss later in
this chapter.
The cost factors derived from the figures shown in Table 8.11 are predicted requirements
for recapitalization construction, based on PRV of facilities in those regions. To
better understand the difference between the requirements estimates our method produces
and actual MILCON spending, we developed a comparison to actual spending.
First, we took aggregate PRV levels for the United States and several key overseas
countries and regions.40 We then estimated the annual recapitalization requirement
using the 67-year guideline. Next, we compared actual MILCON spending for these same regions to our PRV-derived estimates. The results of this comparison are shown
in Figure 8.4.

<a href= "pic86.html">Figure 8.4 omparison of PRV-Derived Recapitalization Needs and MILCON Spending</a><br><br>

In this figure, various countries and regions are shown along the y-axis. The
length of each bar shows how MILCON spending for that region has compared with
our PRV-estimated recapitalization requirement. The top series of bars shows average
FYs 2011C2013 MILCON spending relative to the MILCON recapitalization requirements
we estimated; the bottom series shows maximum one-year MILCON spending
for FYs 2011C2013 versus the requirements estimates.41 Starting at the top, the first
red bar shows that for the United States (excluding territories), MILCON spending
during that time period was about 78 percent of our PRV-derived requirements estimate.
Spending for the UK and Germany are very close to this ratio. Spending in Italy
is lower, and it is significantly lower in Japan and South Korea. 

The same trend is consistent in the bottom section, which shows the one-year
maximum MILCON spending versus the estimated requirement. The United States,
UK, and Germany are all roughly comparable, Italy is noticeably lower, and Japan and
South Korea are still lower. We deduce several things from this. First, the similarity
among the United States, UK, and Germany is consistent with our understanding that
the latter two countries provide little, if any, MILCON support purely for recapitalization.
42 Second, DoD MILCON spending for U.S. installations in these three countries
is, on average, no more than about 80 percent of a simple 67-year PRV-based recapitalization
calculation.
Further, South Korea and Japan appear to offset a significant amount of MILCON
spending the DoD would normally provide for facility recapitalization. We do not want
to make too much of the exact percentages, because of the small sample size and variation
within only three years of data (e.g., MILCON cost in Japan varied by an order
of magnitude from year to year for these three years, reflecting the factors discussed
above). However, the trend seems clear and is consistent with what is reported on
HNS: In relative terms, DoD spends significantly less on MILCON for installations in
Japan and South Korea as compared with those in Europe and the United States. We
assume this is due to HNS provided by these countries, as discussed in Chapter Seven.
Because of what these findings suggest, we adjust our PRV-derived recapitalization
requirements to better capture what actual DoD spending would be for installations
in these regions. Therefore, for our cost models, we make the following adjustments
to the estimates:
 baseline estimate
CC U.S. and Europe: 80 percent of calculated value
CC Japan and South Korea: 40 percent of calculated value
 upper bound estimate
CC U.S. and Europe: 80 percent of calculated value
CC Japan and South Korea: 60 percent of calculated value.
For the U.S. and Europe estimates, we simply adjust them to be more in line with
what actual MILCON spending looks like on average. For Japan and South Korea, our
logic is as follows. As a baseline for our cost calculations, we use a 40 percent adjustment
to mirror the data analysis shown above and to parallel the adjustment made to
U.S. and European bases. The MILCON portion for Japan is lower on average, but the
few values we have varied widely in just a few years. Thus, we use a more conservative
estimate and use 40 percent for both South Korea and Japan. For the upper bound, we
use a different adjustment for Japan and South Korea. We were told by Marine Corps personnel that Japan offsets 25 percent of its MILCON recapitalization requirement
(but a little more than 25 percent of the actual construction costs since Japan budgets
to only about 90 percent of the requirement).43 If we use 80 percent as a starting point
for all PRV-generated MILCON estimates, and then multiply that estimate by 75 percent
(per the Marine Corps), the resulting factor is 0.8 x 0.75 = 60 percent. We use
the lower, baseline estimate for Japan and South Korea in our posture cost estimates in
Chapter Ten but point out the potential difference if the higher factor is used.
Dependent Education
DoD, by means of the DoD Education Activity (DoDEA), administers and delivers
programs that provide education for the dependents of military personnel both in
the United States and overseas. Two of these programs are relevant to our cost analysis.
DoD Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS) support
those in the United States, and DoD Dependents Schools (DoDDS) provide education
to those overseas.44 We excluded impact aid from our analysis.45
We obtained data from DoDEA operating costs for FYs 2009C2011 at the installation
level. Table 8.12 summarizes the data.46
Table 8.12 shows the total number of installations with DDESS and DoDDS
support and the total annual operating costs (average FYs 2009C2011) for those facilities
for the United States, Europe, Japan, and South Korea. Most U.S. installations do
not have DDESS support. Half of those that do are Army installations. DDESS has a
presence at seven Army installations in the United States, and those installations have
about a third of Army personnel stationed in the United States. Thus, it is possible that
Army forces realigning to the United States will relocate to a base with DDESS support.
Most overseas installations do have DoDDS support (28 out of 34 locations with more than 1,000 active duty personnel, 40 out of 79 installations with more than 100
active duty personnel).
To derive cost factors for dependents’ education, we performed a least-squares
regression analysis, using the DMDC personnel data applied to each installation in
the data set summarized in Table 8.12. Table 8.13 shows the results of our regression
analysis. 

<a href= "pic87.html">Table 8.12 Summary of DoDEA Cost Data, by Region</a><br><br>

<a href= "pic88.html">Table 8.13 Regression Analysis Results for DoDEA Annual Costs, by Region</a><br><br>


In this table, the fixed cost represents the cost that would be saved by DoD for
DoDEA services if a single installation where DoDEA is active were closed. Note that
this is not the full cost to the U.S. taxpayer, because most dependents in the United
States attend non-DoD schools, with service members contributing local taxes when
appropriate and federal impact aid compensating when the service members and their
families live on base on federal property and thus do not pay property tax.
In the course of our regression analysis, we found that Europe and Japan had similar
dependents’ education costs, so we grouped them into one category for the purpose
of estimating cost parameters. It is apparent from looking at the data points for bases in
South Korea that their costs differ from other countries and regions, but there were too
few data points to develop a meaningful regression model. But this is also consistent
with the fact that accompanied tours in South Korea remain limited. We therefore do
not include a cost estimate for dependents’ education activities at Korean bases. Our posture options in Chapter Nine do not explore closing any bases in South Korea, so
this does not affect our net cost results.
The variable cost represents the cost per person borne for each service member.
Because most overseas installations do have DoDDS support, for our cost calculations,
we assume all forces incur overseas DoDDS costs. Because few U.S. installations have
DDESS support, when we do our cost calculations, we assume the following as a baseline
for forces realigning to the United States:
 One-third of Army forces move to installations with DDESS support. We thus
subtract one-third of the U.S. DDESS variable cost from the appropriate region’s
variable cost differential to estimate the savings per person.
 All other forces move to installations with no DDESS support. We thus count
the full DoDDS variable cost for the appropriate region toward the savings for
realigning forces from overseas to the United States.


Regional Logistics Costs
This section discusses regional logistics costs not assigned to personnel or installations,
but which must be allocated to reflect the real cost burden on DoD to support
overseas forces. The most relevant activities in this category are Defense Logistics
Agency (DLA) distribution centers and transoceanic transportation costs. DoD activities
that need supplies to conduct operations or other activities purchase supplies from
the service and DLA working capital funds, transferring operations and maintenance
funding to do so. The prices they pay are based on the acquisition cost of the material,
which covers the cost of transportation for delivery to DoD or first destination
transportation, and a cost recovery rate or surcharge to cover the working capital fund
organization’s overhead and operational costs; the working capital fund organizations
have to recover their costs on a reimbursable basis. The surcharges do include second
destination transportation (SDT) for the delivery of supplies within CONUS; however,
they do not include over-the-ocean SDT, called “over the ocean transportation”
(OOT), which is ultimately paid through central service accounts. Therefore, overseas
customers actually slightly subsidize U.S. customers’ SDT whenever they order an
item since overall CONUS SDT is included in item prices. Thus, the costs reflected
in overseas operations and maintenance accounts are slightly inflated with U.S. SDT
costs. Conversely, since those overseas customers are not directly charged for their
own OOT, with these costs paid centrally, their spending does not reflect the full cost
of operations. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the costs of transportation for the
delivery of supplies overseas as well as to estimate the amount by which these overseas
customers subsidize CONUS sustainment. The difference between these two costs is the amount of additional overseas transportation we need to account for in determining
the variable costs of overseas logistics with respect to transportation.
Additionally, OCONUS support is based on a combination of direct delivery from
CONUS defense distribution depots and regional forward distribution depots (FDDs),
adding a layer to the support of OCONUS operational forces. These OCONUS FDDs
play a significant role in minimizing the OCONUS transportation cost difference
but add facility fixed and variable operating costs and require additional total inventory
in the system to be effective. In sum, delivering material to overseas forces costs
more than delivering to forces in the United States, consisting of the transportation
and FDDs―and the requisite inventory―used in tandem to do this in the lowest cost
manner possible.
Incremental Transportation Costs for the Delivery of Supplies Overseas
To estimate annual transportation costs within CONUS and OCONUS for the delivery
of supplies, we extracted data on CONUS and OOT costs from the Strategic Distribution
Database at RAND and used the data to directly compute the cost of transportation
by region.47 We calculated the total cost of OOT for supplies by service and
region and subtracted the amount of U.S. SDT they would have subsidized (by using
regional transaction data), and then we scaled the difference to a per-person cost. We
show the results of this calculation in Table 8.14, which shows the incremental OOT
cost per person.

<a href= "pic89.html">Table 8.14 Annual Over the Ocean Transportation Costs per Person, by Service and Region</a><br><br>

DLA Forward Distribution Depots Costs
We then estimated costs for the second component of DLA overseas support, the FDDs
themselves. This includes the transactional costs of the overseas facilities. We obtained
data from DLA on the annual operating costs of its distribution centers. Table 8.15
summarizes the cost data. 

 <a href= "pic90.html">Table 8.15 DLA Forward Distribution Depot Data</a><br><br>

In Table 8.15, each FDD is shown on a separate row, and U.S. locations are
totaled for comparison. The first column shows the average operating costs (millions of
dollars), from the DLA data; the next column shows the total military personnel from
the DMDC data, and the last column simply divides the former by the latter. Here,
the Guam FDD supports only forces on Guam. The FDD at Sigonella mainly supports
the Navy and transiting ships.
The main FDD in Europe, in Germersheim, Germany, also provides support
to contingency operations in the Middle East, so it is important to separate the costs
incurred to support forces in the region where the FDD is located from the costs
incurred to support forces deployed to contingency operations in another theater.48 In
our cost model, we add the cost per person rate for Europe, Japan, and South Korea.
We assign Guam costs only to Guam, and Sigonella costs only to naval forces in that
region.
Summary of Recurring Fixed Costs
To provide an integrated view of some of these costs, we now show all recurring fixed
costs that inform our cost model. Figure 8.5 shows each component of the fixed cost
differences by region for bases with operational forces.


In Figure 8.5, the height of each column shows the total fixed-cost component of
overseas military installations by service and region, along the x-axis, i.e., the approximate
annual cost that could be saved by closing an installation of a given service in a given region. Because some costs differ between Japan and South Korea within
PACOM, we show these separately. Also, the Air Force costs reflect an additional overseas
premium for combat support, the military personnel providing installation support,
because we find a higher number of “fixed” combat support personnel per base
overseas; these personnel also incur the higher overseas variable cost, which is not
accounted for in the combat support PE costs in the AFTOC data. We explain this
cost in depth in Appendix A. The chart shows that installation-support costs usually
comprise the majority of the fixed cost for installations, between about half and threequarters
of the total for overseas installations.
<a href= "pic91.html">Figure 8.5 Summary of Fixed Cost Components, Bases with Operational Forces</a><br><br>

Summary of Incremental Overseas Variable Costs
We now provide the same view of the variable costs within our cost model, integrating
all the components discussed throughout this chapter. Figure 8.6 shows each component
of the variable costs among the regions, relative to the same for the United States.
In Figure 8.6, the height of each column shows the relative per-person difference
to have a military person stationed overseas, rather than in the United States (the graph
is started in negative territory for Japan and South Korea to produce the right net value
at the top of the columns, because the MILCON is a negative value for those two locations
due to lower costs than CONUS). The results are shown by service and region, along the x-axis. Because some costs differ between Japan and South Korea within
PACOM, we show these separately.
The chart shows that differential allowances and PCS costs for personnel stationed
overseas comprise the vast majority of the variable cost differential for each service and
region, between about 60 percent and 80 percent of the total. Installation-support
costs do not appear at all, because there was not a statistically significant variable cost
difference between the U.S. and overseas locations for that category. When contemplating
a realignment of, but not reduction in, forces, only the differential matters. For
MILCON, PACOM bases had a lower cost per person than their U.S. counterparts,
because we incorporate a discount factor to account for the HNS contributions of
Japan and South Korea. Also, as with the fixed costs in Figure 8.5, the Air Force costs
in Figure 8.6 reflect the additional premium for combat support, the military personnel
providing installation support, because we find that they increase with the number
of operational personnel and also incur the higher overseas variable cost. We explain
this in detail in Appendix A.

<a href= "pic92.html">Figure 8.6 Summary of Incremental Variable Cost Components</a><br><br>

We now show the final result of our cost model, with all fixed and incremental
components, for bases with operational forces. Table 8.16 shows the total of all fixed
and incremental variable components, by service and region, for overseas basing and
stationing. This is net of any HNS and includes all the cost components in our modeling
(except for unit training cost differences since they are dependent on unit types, not bases and number of people), which aimed at capturing as complete a picture of
the costs that overseas basing affect as possible: allowances, PCS, installation support,
MILCON, dependents’ education, and regional logistics. We use these figures directly
in our calculations of the aggregate cost effects of posture options discussed later in
this report.
As an example, suppose a fighter squadron were moved from Europe back to the
United States. If it were an F-16 squadron from Aviano Air Base, that would comprise
about 685 personnel from the squadron plus a slight reduction in the wing headquarters.
At $38,800 per person, that would save about $26.5 million per year given the
variable costs shown in Table 8.16. Given the training cost differences for an F-16 unit
shown in Table 8.1 (about $0.3 million lower per F-16 in Europe than in the United
States), that would offset about $6.3 million for 21 aircraft, so the total annual savings
for operating and support costs would be about $20.2 million for the single squadron.
That excludes the cost of any rotational deployments to replace the permanent presence
or any investment costs to make the move (e.g., one-time movements or new construction
in the United States). However, if both squadrons were realigned, and Aviano were
closed, that would entail $40.4 million in savings for the unit moves and $211 million
for base closure, for a total of $251 million per year.49

<a href= "pic93.html">Table 8.16 Overall Recurring Annual Cost Model for Overseas Basing and Stationing</a><br><br>


Alternatively, suppose Vicenza, Italy, were closed and all forces, including the
173rd Airborne BCT, were moved to the United States. That would save $32.7 million
for the 2,165 operational military personnel. The military and civilians supporting the
garrison would essentially transfer to the United States. Those 174 military personnel would save another $2.6 million. Then another $21.3 million would be saved in
reduced training costs, and $115 million would be saved for the fixed cost of the installation.
This would total $172 million per year, again not including rotational deployments
or investment costs.
Rotational Cost Analysis
The purpose of this section is to assess the costs of non-contingency rotational operations
to understand the cost implications if they were to be used to compensate for
reduced permanent overseas presence or how much they would cost if used to increase
presence and engagement.50 In this section, we describe our methodology for calculating
rotational costs. We then show the results of our quantitative analysis for several
illustrative examples.
Figure 8.7 shows a schematic of our cost model. The box on the left shows the
inputs to the model. These are the parameters that drive different cost profiles for a
given rotational deployment. The unit type drives the personnel and equipment that
must be transported back and forth for rotations. The region determines the distances
traveled, expenses for personnel during travel, and any special compensation paid to
unit personnel. The frequency and duration determine how often a given unit type
does a rotation and how long they stay deployed. For example, one could provide 100
percent forward presence (i.e., 365 days/year) with one 12-month rotation per year,
two six-month rotations, etc. The frequency and duration of rotations are driven by the
strategic aims of the rotational presence. Finally, there are several policy options available
to provide equipment and personnel support, which we describe below.

<a href= "pic94.html">Figure 8.7 Rotational Cost Computations</a><br><br>


The box in the middle shows the components of rotational costs that the model
calculates. Deployment and redeployment costs reflect those to transport the unit and
its equipment (and aircraft in the case of air units) to and from the overseas location.

Personnel support costs during deployment include food, lodging, and special compensation.
Policy option costs are those associated with whether or not to preposition
equipment sets and the level of installation support present at rotationally deployed
locations. While a unit does incur training costs while deployed, we exclude training
costs during the operation. We assume that the training each unit receives during the
deployment is used to satisfy a portion of its annual training requirement. Additionally,
we assume no change in the force structure would be needed to support rotations.51
The box on the right articulates the level of detail of the outputs. The model calculates
the total cost to sustain rotations by the specific unit type to the specified location
under the conditions (frequency, duration, and policy options) specified. For example,
it would cost approximately $100 million per year to sustain two three-month deployments
per year of an IBCT to South Korea.
The following sections explain more about the components of rotational operations
(including our data sources and methods), policy options important to the cost calculations,
and some example rotational deployment packages to illustrate our approach.
We note here that this cost model applies to the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps
but not the Navy, with the partial exception of aircraft units.
Components of Rotational Presence
We break down a rotational deployment by its component parts and calculate the costs
of each element. We then sum these to compute a total cost for a rotational deployment
under each set of policies. We seek to capture the total costs that DoD would
incur to support each cost element and deployment. For a given rotational package,
a unit could incur a range of costs. We divide these costs into five categories: personnel
deployment; aircraft deployment; unit equipment deployment, prepositioning, and
maintenance; personnel support during a deployment; and special compensation. In
the following sections, we discuss these cost elements, data sources, and our cost estimation
methods.
Personnel Deployment and Redeployment
The cost to deploy and redeploy unit personnel to and from a deployment simply translates
to their airfare. For each unit type specified in our posture options, we derive force
packages from standard service-specific data sets or models. For the USAF, we use
the Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK),52 for the Army,
we used the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command’s Deployment Planning Guide,53 and for the Marine Corps, we drew unit personnel and equipment
requirements from the Organization of Marine Corps Forces.54
Aircraft Deployment and Redeployment
Calculations for the USAF require the additional component of flying aircraft to and
from home-station. To do this, we derived cost per flying hour for each aircraft from
the AFTOC database.55 For each aircraft type, we took the cost elements that vary by
flying hour and divided them by the total flying hours for that mission design series
(MDS).56 We averaged the costs from 2009 through 2011.
We calculated the average distance from the United States to each overseas region
or country of interest to approximate the deployment distance for a typical aircraft
deployment. We then determined the typical block speed of each MDS to determine
the average flight time for each MDS.57 With the flight time and cost per flying hour,
we could then calculate the cost to deploy each MDS. The model multiplies this cost
times the number of aircraft in each deployment for each location. For fighters, we also
add a tanker air bridge to help deploy (and redeploy) the aircraft.58
Unit Equipment Deployment, Prepositioning, and Maintenance
We include three options in the model to provide equipment for rotationally deployed
units: sealift deployment, airlift deployment, and prepositioning. Each method has
costs and benefits (e.g., financial cost, speed, flexibility), and all may not be possible
in all circumstances. We tally the costs of each for each rotational deployment, and
use the range of estimates to define upper and lower bounds for our aggregate cost
calculations.
For sealift and airlift deployment, we use the same data sources to derive force
packages as for unit personnel but to derive equipment lists instead. When necessary,
we cross-referenced these data with the DoD’s Federal Logistics (FEDLOG) database
to obtain weight and cube data for calculating shipping costs.59 To estimate the cost to DoD of deploying these personnel and equipment to and from home station, we
used standard TRANSCOM rates and applied them to the cargo being transported.60
When estimating the costs for rotating an entire MEU, we assumed an Amphibious
Squadron (PHIBRON) would transport the MEU, thus obviating the need to pay
separately for personnel and equipment transportation.61
Prepositioning entails each service keeping sets of equipment in storage locations
and periodically maintaining them to ensure mission readiness. A given service
may have enough equipment sets (especially in light of planned drawdowns) to
place an “extra” set in storage for this purpose, thus saving the purchase price of such
equipment. However, equipment must be replaced at some point, so prepositioned
stocks would eventually have to be recapitalized. For the calculations in this report,
we assume that each service owns adequate equipment sets to support prepositioning,
and we do not incorporate equipment recapitalization. The services provided information
we were able to use to estimate the cost to have contractors store and maintain the
equipment sets.62 If equipment purchase or recapitalization were needed, that would
add an additional cost to the prepositioning options.
Personnel Support During Deployment
DoD personnel receive essentially one of two types of support or compensation when
forward deployed in peacetime. Food, lodging, transportation, etc., can be provided by
the destination military base, if those services are available, local contractor support,
or by per diem with which personnel can procure those services on the local market.
For short deployments (e.g., a 1C2 week exercise), units often make do with more austere
conditions, such as sleeping in the field and using field kitchens. The rotational
deployments our posture options explore are typically too long to assume austere conditions,
so we make several assumptions about providing personnel support, based on
the region and country.
For all regions, destination bases are assumed to provide support by means of
permanent facilities and personnel. In regions with a current permanent DoD presence
(e.g., Western Europe, Japan, South Korea), this assumes that the service overseeing
the installation will keep facilities and other support in-place in the event of any
unit realignments, or more will be constructed to handle rotational forces if needed.
In short, at least one base able to host rotational forces will be maintained in these
regions. In other regions, in practice, it may be DoD or the host nation that provides
or pays for these services. In Romania and Bulgaria, for example, these nations provide some support for U.S. rotational forces. Thus, as an upper-bound cost, we assume that
DoD will pay the host nation for this facility support. For a lower-bound estimate, we
exclude these base operating costs from our calculations, assuming that DoD maintains
ongoing capabilities in the region able to also support rotational forces. To pay
for the day-to-day installation support and upkeep of those facilities, we apply the cost
factors for installation support that we developed earlier in this chapter. We include in
this the per-person variable costs for installation support, MILCON for recapitalization,
and overseas logistics support. We exclude dependents’ education, because service
members’ dependents are living at home-station. Further, we decrement these installation-
support costs by 25 percent to represent reduced needs since dependents will not
be living on base (e.g., family housing, family and youth programs).
Beyond day-to-day facility operations and sustainment, we also assess the costs
to provide food and other incidentals. For forces in regions without current permanent
presence, we assume that food service is provided by local contractors, as has been
done for contingency operations or in countries in which the United States performs
rotational deployments on an ongoing basis. To estimate these costs, we use the local
food per diem rate as a proxy for this contractor support. The DoD Defense Travel
Management Office provides detailed per diem rates for travel to a range of countries
and cities in the world.63 We utilized these per diem factors for the overseas locations
identified in our posture options. When costs for specific locations were not available,
we used average regional costs.64
For forces deploying to regions with current permanent presence, we apply a
COLA as compensation. However, COLA factors available from sources like the FCM
or the aggregate figures we developed from Work Experience/Active Duty Pay files are
averages across the entire population for a given service and region. Since these averages
include some personnel living with dependents and off base, and the rotational deployments
for which we calculate costs assume personnel deploy unaccompanied and live
on base, the average values would overestimate COLAs needed to compensate deploying
personnel. These deployments would also be shorter and more austere than multiyear
PCS tours, where personnel would have a certain anticipated standard of living.
For these reasons, we apply only 50 percent of the COLA costs for each person for the
region of their deployment.65 Finally, because we already make provision for food and lodging, we apply the local incidental per diem rate to all personnel in all regions for
the duration of their deployment.
Special Compensation
DoD provides special compensation to those deploying overseas away from their homestation
location. This includes family separation and hardship pay. We apply family
separation for all deployments and hardship pay for all deployments outside of Western
Europe, Japan, and South Korea.
Example Rotational Deployment Cost Calculations
In this section, we review the details of a few example rotational deployment packages
to demonstrate how the cost analysis works. First, we show a detailed example of
an Army deployment to explain how we apply our methodology to each of the components
of rotational deployment. Table 8.17 shows three example deployment cost
calculations of an ABCT deploying from the United States to Germany, varying the
frequency and duration of rotations such that the examples all produce 12 months of
presence per year.
In Table 8.17, the top section shows the basic information about the unit and its
deployment, including the frequency and duration of deployment. The middle section
shows the component cost calculations. The bottom section totals the costs for each of
the three equipment support options.

<a href= "pic95.html">Table 8.17 Costs of Rotational Components for ABCT Deployment from United States to Germany</a><br><br>


In the middle section, one can see how the deployment costs vary for air and
sealift, but not prepositioning. The rest of the costs, for personnel and installation support,
are static, because the total duration of presence is always 12 months. The bottom
section, with totals, shows that airlift is significantly more expensive than sealift or
prepositioning. The ABCT is an extreme case because of its equipment weight, but in
general, airlift to transport equipment is not a realistic option for recurring peacetime
rotations for brigade-sized ground forces. Further, the left-most column shows that for
a single 12-month deployment, prepositioning is more expensive than sealift. On the
right side, however, as deployment costs increase with increased frequency, the prepositioning
option is slightly less expensive than using airlift. Sealift requires much more
time in transit, which has its own non-monetary costs.
For each service, unit type, and region, the trade-offs look slightly different,
depending on unit size, transportation rates, and prepositioning costs. For our cost
analysis, we use this same approach of calculating the cost of each rotational component
and then aggregating into total costs. We now show two more examples to show
the broader trade-offs involved with rotational operations, and how they compare with
savings from reducing permanent presence. We show another ground force example
using an Army Stryker brigade, and an Air Force example using an F-16 squadron. 

Figure 8.8 shows the cost breakdown for an SBCT rotation from the United
States to Germany. In this chart, the total time spent deployed is shown on the x-axis,
and the total cost per year is on the y-axis. The blue areas show the amount saved by
realigning an SBCT from Europe (the lower shaded area only) and closing a base there
as well (the top of the shaded areas). The lines and dots depict the cost of each of several
options.
Figure 8.8 shows two equipment options―sealift and prepositioning―and three
deployment frequency/duration pairs. The solid purple line shows the cost relationship
of sending the SBCT on three-month deployments using airlift for personnel and
sealift for equipment. At the bottom left, the cost of one three-month deployment per
year is about $63 million per year, including all the costs described above. To increase
the total time deployed forward (y-axis), there must be more deployments, with the
gaps between them determining the average amount of annual presence, as indicated
on the x-axis. As the number of three-month deployments per year increases from two,
to three, to four, the deployment costs go up due to the increased airlift for deploying
personnel and sealift for equipment, which vary linearly with deployments per year,
as well as the personnel support, which is driven by the total duration or amount of
presence during the year. At 12 months of presence, or four rotations per year, the cost
reaches about $169 million for this option.

<a href= "pic96.html">Figure 8.8 Rotational Deployment Costs for Stryker BCT from United States to Germany</a><br><br>


The dotted purple line reflects the use prepositioning equipment instead of sealifting
it for each rotation. Because the equipment must be supported year-round, it comes
with a high fixed cost, so this option is more expensive than the sealift option when the
annual length of presence is limited, in this case less than six months, as sealift only
has to be paid for when it used. As the number of deployments increases, however, the
cost of prepositioning stays the same, so that option looks comparably better. For four
three-month deployments, prepositioning is significantly less expensive for the SBCT.
The two red lines show the same trade-off for six-month deployments. Here,
because there are fewer round trips to pay for, the prepositioning option does not save
money over using sealift, and they cost about the same for two six-month deployments.
Finally, with one 12-month deployment, the proportions are reversed. Sealift becomes
less expensive than prepositioning for this unit.
We contrast these cost estimates with the savings estimates shown by the two blue
blocks. The lower, light blue area shows the annual savings from simply realigning that
SBCT from Europe to the United States, incorporating all the variable cost savings described earlier in this chapter, which comes to about $75 million per year. The dark
blue area reflects also closing a single installation, adding about $87 million per year
to these savings.
What this shows is that the cost-savings trade-off depends greatly on the policy
options chosen. If an SBCT were realigned but the base was not closed, most rotational
options would cost DoD more money than leaving the unit in place. The least costly
12-month deployment option still produces a net cost of about $20 million per year. If
less presence were needed, those realignment savings could offset the rotational costs
for three or six months of presence per year, but it would still be roughly a break-even
proposition.
On the other hand, if an installation could be closed, saving the higher total
amount, that could underwrite all the options shown in Figure 8.8. Even providing 12
months of presence per year with three-month deployments would save money with
prepositioning and nearly break even with sealift, and would save about $67 million
per year with the lowest-cost policy option of one 12-month deployment via sealift per
year.
However, if a base were to be closed and its forces realigned, another permanent
base in that country or region must be maintained to support the rotating forces
(including considerations of facilities, space, and other accommodations) or a host
nation must agree to provide access to one of their bases.
In the next example, we show similar trade-offs for two F-16 squadrons rotating
to Japan. In this example, we use two squadrons of F-16s simply because most overseas
bases have two fighter squadrons, thus making a more even comparison when looking
at base closure savings. This chart follows the same format as the prior one.
In Figure 8.9, we see the same types of cost trade-offs as for the prior figure.
Here, prepositioning only offers real cost advantages over short, frequent deployment
options. In this case, merely relocating the units to the United States is just barely
enough to pay for even a single three-month rotation, let alone longer or more frequent
ones, given the annual savings of $19 million per year for relocating a single F-16
squadron from Japan to the United States.66 If shorter, more frequent deployments
were preferred, the savings would be quickly overridden. We note that this trade-off is
uniform regardless of the number of aircraft of this type. The costs and savings both
scale evenly with the number of personnel and aircraft.

<a href= "pic97.html">Figure 8.9 Rotational Deployment Costs for F-16s from United States to Japan</a><br><br>


When contemplating a base closure, however, the story looks different. Because
we estimate that overseas USAF installations have a significantly higher fixed cost,
which would be saved upon closing a base, this option more than offsets any of the rotational
deployment options considered here. The total recurring savings from realigning the two squadrons and closing the base are around $207 million per year (or about
$215 million if the upper-bound estimate for MILCON recapitalization is used). That
would enable robust rotational deployments while still achieving substantial savings.
However, it should be noted that the base closure options we consider here would preclude
the use of that same base for rotational operations. Those forces would have to
deploy to another base in the country or region.
Unit Rotation Costs
We show cost calculations for a range of unit types in several regions to provide a
means to explore combinations of rotational deployments.67 Table 8.18 shows the estimated
annual costs of rotational deployments for three types of Army BCTs to three
different regions. Each row shows the cost for a single rotation during the year, with
the duration shown on the left side. Sealift as a transportation mode applies only to
equipment; personnel are transported by airlift.

<a href= "pic98.html">Table 8.18 Example Rotational Deployment Cost Calculations for Army Units ($ millions)</a><br><br>


Table 8.19 shows the annual costs of rotational deployments for four types of Air
Force units to three different regions. Again, each entry includes the cost for a single
rotation during the year, with the duration shown on the left side.

Investment Cost Methodology
This section explains and demonstrates our methodology for estimating the investment
costs necessary to transition from the current posture to an alternative posture. First,
we discuss the data sources to which we looked to derive investment cost estimates.
Next, we describe each element of investment cost needed to alter the posture. Finally,
we demonstrate our methods with some example calculations.
Data Sources
To identify the cost elements relevant to posture changes, we looked to two main
sources. We first sought reports on actual overseas realignments and closures. Although
there have been a number of overseas base closures and force realignments since the
end of the Cold War and even before, there are few sources that catalog the implementation
costs borne by the United States for individual actions (i.e., the closure of a
single installation), let alone a more comprehensive analysis across a number of installations,
countries, or regions. Often the available sources focus on one or another specific
cost or issue, and thus do not comprehensively discuss or analyze all of the details of
closure or realignment actions. In our research, we found reports on base closures in Torrejon, Spain,68 the European drawdown (specifically highlighting base closures in
Germany from the late 1960s through the early 1990s),69 and U.S. bases in Thailand.70
The second source we looked to was BRAC documents and data. While the specific
cost factors used for the various rounds of BRAC do not always mirror the costs of
similar actions for overseas locations, these sources provided a framework for the general
cost categories relevant to relocating forces and closing installations, and provide a
starting point for estimating some cost factors. The BRAC cost-estimation model itself
was not readily available for use, and even the detailed commission reports did not
provide enough granularity to back-out rough cost factors for realignment and closure
costs. We thus looked to detailed data documentation to establish the specific inputs
to each BRAC action and their associated costs.71
After consulting these sources and synthesizing their findings, we created cost
factors for three broad categories: personnel-related movement and separation, baserelated
closure costs, and new construction for realigning units. We now describe the
cost elements in each category and our methods for estimating the costs.
Personnel-Related Movement and Separation
This category of personnel-related costs includes the one-time costs associated with
moving personnel and their dependents for a unit realignment, paying for persons
separated as part of a base or unit consolidation, and transportation of unit equipment.
For the movement of military personnel and their families, we use the standard
overseas PCS rates for overseas to U.S. movements (i.e., transoceanic) for a single move
(i.e., not annual rates). We referenced these earlier in this chapter. We used the same
cost factors for civilian moves as well.72 We thus apply these additional cost factors for
civilian personnel.
For realignments within a region, we use U.S. PCS rates for military and civilian
personnel, assuming movement will take place over land. For realignments from one
overseas region to another, we use the overseas PCS move rates for both military and
civilian personnel. 

For civilians who are separated in a realignment (e.g., headquarters units no
longer needed, base or unit consolidations), we include severance pay, early retirement,
and unemployment compensation based on information from the most recent BRAC
round.73
In the past, some of the PCS moves accompanying a base closure have been
phased in as a part of normal periodic personnel rotations, so no additional PCS movement
is needed. So we consider our cost estimates to be an upper bound on the onetime
move costs, assuming all personnel require a move outside the timing of their
normal restationing.
One additional per-person cost found in the BRAC documentation is called
program management. This represents the costs of administrative support for movements
of personnel and equipment and is estimated as a per-person percentage overhead
fee on top of the individual personnel expenses described above. For this category,
we looked to major U.S. installation closures and realignments from the 2005
BRAC round from which to derive costs. We developed per-person cost estimates from
each example, and then averaged these costs across the examples (dismissing the highest
and lowest values in each set). The result was an average per-person cost for program
management costs. Table 8.20 shows these cost factors.
<a href= "pic100.html">Table 8.20 Personnel-Related Closure and Realignment Cost Factors</a><br><br>


We used these per-person costs as inputs to our total cost calculations. For each
person realigned in one of the posture options, whether to/from the United States or
across regions, we apply these cost factors to estimate the total one-time cost to realign
these personnel and their equipment. For unit moves, we use TRANSCOM sealift
shipping rates to and from the appropriate region. As an upper bound, we assume
military and civilian moves pay both PCS and program management costs. As a lower
bound, we exclude the PCS move costs, assuming that those moves can be made over
time as a part of normal personnel rotations.

Base-Related Closure Costs
Base closure costs include, but are not limited to, support contract termination, mothball/
shutdown,74 severance to foreign civilians, labor contract settlement costs, and a
range of one-time unique costs.75 These are the key costs we include in our analysis.
The closure of a military installation also inevitably includes environmental mitigation
costs. The overall scope of these costs vary widely from installation to installation,
and cleanup requirements have changed significantly over the past few decades
during which many closures have occurred. In addition, the cost-sharing burden for
these kinds of costs varies depending on the region and country, and the United States’
relations with the host nation government.
A 2004 GAO report had this to say about environmental remediation costs:
Historically, overseas regional commands have incurred limited costs for environmental
remediation as a result of these property returns. For example, the component
commands in South Korea and Japan have incurred limited costs to date,
while EUCOM currently estimates its potential costs for environmental remediation
at about $90 million, regardless of whether the property is returned in the
future. However, in the future, there is less certainty regarding potential costs
for environmental remediation because these issues are becoming an increasing
concern in South Korea and Japan. For example, according to PACOM officials,
South Korea has established procedures for addressing environmental remediation,
and the Government of Japan is enacting more stringent environmental laws.76
For these reasons, we exclude environmental mitigation costs from our total base closure
cost estimates.
For data sources, we looked to the reports on the closure process for the overseas
closures listed above, and the BRAC data for major installation closures.77 In particular,
the overseas closure reports provided cost estimates due to local national employee
litigations, as well as residual value negotiated settlements. Some of the U.S. costs we
use may be different from those that would actually occur during an overseas closure.
The data available to inform these estimates were sparse, so we looked to the best available
sources. We intend these calculations as illustrative of the kinds of costs that could
accompany an overseas base closure.

We developed per-base cost estimates from each example and then averaged these
costs across the examples (dismissing the highest and lowest values in each set). The
result was an average per-base cost for each category. The list below shows the cost factors
we developed for base closures:
 support contract termination: $0C10.9 million
 mothball/shutdown: $312,000 (average)
 one-time unique costs: $0C10.5 million
 litigation and local employee settlements: $19.2 million
 total: $312,000C40.9 million.
We used these per-base costs as inputs to our total cost calculations.
New Construction
For each unit realigned to the United States, or within a region, there is a potential
need for new construction to provide barracks; training operations morale, welfare,
and recreation; and more. However, recent and planned force reductions will free up
some facilities for use by units being realigned to the United States. For example, the
Army is planning to draw down the force by 80,000 troops, and our posture options
contemplate only a fraction of that number of soldiers being realigned to the United
States. Thus, one could argue that in many cases excess capacity will be freed up to
accommodate these moves or the units could inactivate in place. We estimate the
potential construction costs necessary to accommodate all realigning forces and consider
these an upper bound to the expense DoD might incur to perform these realignments.
As a lower bound, we assume the Army can absorb all realigning forces at
existing U.S. bases with existing infrastructure, thus eliminating one-time MILCON
expenditures for force realignments. While the Marine Corps is downsizing as well,
it reports that it would not have slack capacity to absorb realigned units because it is
already short of capacity to support the 2012 level of 202,000 personnel. During the
buildup, temporary facilities were employed, and MILCON was not programmed for
expansion of facilities.78 We assume that the Air Force and Navy would also have to
expand their U.S. facilities if forces were realigned to the United States. If these two
services, especially the Air Force, did have some slack capacity at appropriate U.S.
installations, it would reduce the amount needed for new MILCON below the level of
the overall upper bound estimates shown for the illustrative postures in Chapter Ten.
To derive construction cost estimates, we again looked to the RPAD for data
on total PRV of military installations. Instead of seeking specific MILCON data on
unit moves and construction projects to find analogs to each of our unit moves (which
number up to several dozen), we used a similar approach to the one we developed for estimating annual MILCON recapitalization requirements described earlier in this
chapter.
We took the same inputs we used for the MILCON recapitalization variable cost
estimates developed earlier (Table 8.3), and used the PRVs instead of translating them
to an annual recapitalization expense. In other words, we calculated the total PRV,
by service, but did not divide by the 67-year recapitalization figure. Then we used the
regression results to determine the fixed level of PRV per U.S. base and the variable
level of PRV person for U.S. bases by service. Thus, we arrived at an estimate of the
total variable one-time cost per person to construct new facilities to accommodate
units and personnel arriving at new locations. These estimates ignore constraints or
costs on things like training ranges and airspace:
 Air Force: $180,000
 Army: $159,000
 Navy: $134,000
 Marine Corps: $191,000.
As one can see from these figures, the one-time MILCON expense to accommodate
a single person realigning to a U.S. location ranges from $134,000 to $191,000
per person across the services. These figures comport well with a 2004 Congressional
Budget Office study of overseas Army posture changes.79 That report included
MILCON estimates for unit training facilities (e.g., headquarters, operations); morale,
welfare, and recreation; barracks; and DoD schools. If one aggregates the Congressional
Budget Office study’s costs and inflates them to today’s dollars, the cost is roughly
$135,000 per person.
The Marine Corps also provided us with data to estimate MILCON costs for
realignment of personnel, derived from its recent analysis of construction costs to
accommodate the relocation of forces from Japan to Guam. For reasons we explain
in Appendix A, we believe the estimates derived from this assessment, while based on
detailed facilities analysis and accurate for estimating the MILCON needs in Guam
and somewhat similar circumstances, would overstate the investment costs for a relocation
to a large U.S. base rather than Guam. We therefore use our PRV-calculated estimate
as the baseline value for illustrative posture estimates. Nevertheless, in Chapter
Ten, we show the cost implications of using the Marine Corps’ per-person cost factor
instead of ours, as well as explore some of the cost differences involved with relocating
Marine Corps forces to Guam and Hawaii as opposed to CONUS.

Example Investment Cost Calculations
Now we apply these cost factors to two illustrative example base closures and realignments.
Table 8.21 shows the upper bound of the cost estimate for the investment necessary
to implement the closures of Misawa Air Base in Japan and Ansbach/Illesheim,
Germany, along with the full realignment of all their personnel and unit equipment to
the United States.

<a href= "pic101.html">Table 8.21 Example Investment Cost Calculations</a><br><br>


In Table 8.21, for each example overseas base, we show the inputs at the top,
including personnel and equipment measurement tons. For the equipment shipping
calculations, we use standard TRANSCOM sealift rates from Japan and Germany
to the United States.80 In the second section, we show the movement cost elements
and totals. In the third section, we show the base closure cost. Finally, we show the
MILCON cost for new facilities in the United States, followed by the total implementation
cost.
One can see that MILCON costs, which depend upon whether there would be
sufficient available capacity in CONUS, dominate the total, driving about 90 percent
of the total investment cost. This percentage, for these two examples, is consistent with
the range of calculations we perform for our aggregate cost assessments.


These investment costs should be considered rough estimates, for several reasons.
First, there is quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding the per-person MILCON
cost estimates (details can be seen in Appendix A). Since MILCON drives the overall
investment cost estimates, then, the estimates provided in Chapter Ten should be
treated as rough guides for the costs DoD might incur. Second, because the needs
are very site-specific and can vary greatly, we excluded environmental cleanup from
our total estimates. For similar reasons, we did not consider potential gains from the
residual value of installations returned to the host nation. GAO reported that, between
1989 and 2007, the U.S. government received approximately $592 million in residual
value and payment-in-kind compensation from property returns in EUCOM’s AOR.81
Given these considerations, more detailed analysis would be needed to develop budgetquality
investment cost estimates for overseas posture changes.
Implications for Posture
This chapter assessed the relative costs of maintaining and modifying overseas posture
by utilizing methodologies that estimate the recurring costs of overseas bases and stationed
forces, the costs of rotational presence, and one-time investment requirements
to shift from one posture to another. Beyond creating a useful tool for estimating the
financial effects of posture changes, though, the modeling effort also produced some
general conclusions that can be useful for thinking about how posture affects costs.
Our modeling results support our hypothesis that there are fixed and variable
costs to operating installations and stationing forces. Given fixed costs, to the extent
there are unit inactivations or realignments that can be accomplished by moving forces
to existing bases (even if some MILCON is necessary), consolidation produces savings.
This would apply whether in the United States or overseas, although it may be much
less feasible to consolidate further overseas, given already smaller bases without excess
land capacity and difficulties gaining new, larger bases to replace multiple smaller ones
or gaining expansions with host nations (an exception might be if the United States
were establishing bases in new regions and host nations). Beyond this, we did not find
systematically higher fixed costs for overseas bases. The exception to this was the Air
Force, which we found to have higher fixed costs for overseas bases than for U.S. bases.
Additionally, there are incremental variable recurring costs for stationing personnel
overseas in Europe and the Pacific region due to higher allowances related to the
cost of living and higher PCS move costs. However, there is wide variation among
these incremental costs, such that the cost outcomes of posture changes depend greatly on the service and region under consideration. The incremental differences in other
regions, were posture to shift, might be different.
Combining the variable cost findings of higher variable costs overseas with the
finding that there are fixed costs per base means that consolidating forces at fewer bases
would provide more savings when relocating forces from overseas to the United States
(i.e., closing overseas bases and moving their forces to U.S. bases) than simply consolidating
among bases within overseas regions. The fixed costs would be saved whether
consolidating only in the United States or only in an overseas region, but closing an
overseas base and relocating to the United States also saves on per-person (i.e., variable)
costs due to the higher overseas personnel-related costs (e.g., allowances, PCS costs).
However, the United States cannot repurpose overseas bases as it could in the United
States, which could produce non-DoD economic benefit. We did not examine the
typical benefits gained by the broader economy as the result of U.S. closures.
Finally, the costs of rotational presence present a complex picture. Generally, we
found that the savings produced by merely realigning forces while keeping installations
open is not sufficient to offset the cost of providing full presence through rotational
deployments. In most cases, realignments of permanent forces can underwrite only
partial rotational presence in the same location. If an installation is closed, however,
this will generally offset the costs of full rotational presence, with some net savings.
But the net savings depend greatly on the service, unit type, and location. For ground
forces, sealift to move equipment or available equipment for prepositioning is necessary
for savings. Further, if a base were to be closed and its forces realigned, another
permanent base in that country or region must be maintained to support the rotating
forces (including considerations of facilities, space, and other accommodations) or a
host nation must agree to provide access to one of its bases.
