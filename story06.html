	<hr><br>
	
This report responds to legislation that called for an independent assessment of the
overseas basing presence of U.S. forces. It specifically asked for an assessment of the
location and number of forces needed overseas to execute the national military strategy,
as well as an assessment of the advisability of changes to overseas basing in light of
potential fiscal constraints and the changing strategic environment. We conclude that
there are some enduring minimum overseas posture needs that are necessary to execute
the current national security strategy. The location and minimum number of forces
needed are generated by formal commitments, critical deterrence needs, and the basic
premise in U.S. national strategies and plans that the ability to sustain global power
projection is essential. We also conclude that it is advisable to maintain an overseas
posture that goes beyond these minimums, where the security value-added outweighs
the financial costs and risks. Both how much additional posture and the nature of that
posture that is advisable depend on several key questions that do not have definitive
answers and that require the application of decisionmaker judgment to weigh the benefits
and risks. We identify these questions and the implications of different answers
for the advisability of posture changes in this chapter. Advisability could also depend
on how decisionmakers prioritize the benefits of forward posture versus the value that
could be produced by using the same resources for other defense capabilities.

	<b><a name="T2">Minimum Essential Posture Needs</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

There are several posture elements clearly needed to achieve U.S. strategic goals. The
ability to be globally responsive is at the core of the U.S. national security strategy.
This requires a global network of ports and air bases―infrastructure and access―and
the air and sea lift assets to move forces through that global network. Forward naval
forces also provide response flexibility, as well as playing a role in protecting freedom
of movement for commerce. In addition, there are other global enablers, such as communications
capabilities, that forward forces rely on and that link them to national
capabilities.


Where the United States has identified major threats, in-place forces are essential
for deterrence and to respond immediately to aggression to prevent defeat. This mandates
having presence in South Korea, across East Asia, and in the Middle East, with
the level and nature of advisable presence depending on answers to the key questions
we pose. Similarly, treaty commitments and other agreements to protect partners and
regions against missile and nuclear threats set forth minimum needs in Europe, in
addition to creating the need for greater presence in South Korea, East Asia, and the
Middle East. While these needs establish clear essential elements of overseas posture,
the best set of specific capabilities and locations required within these broad elements
depends on the judgment of policymakers; there may be equally effective substitute
sets. Beyond these foundations, U.S. strategy also seeks to pursue security cooperation
in all regions. Whether that is more cost-effective through permanent presence or
rotational presence―and how much of either might be needed―rests on judgments
regarding the level and nature of engagement necessary to achieve U.S. goals.
Table 11.1 summarizes the essential elements of posture. In the remainder of this
chapter, we discuss the judgments that should inform the specific choices within these
essential elements, particularly with respect to configuring posture to meet deterrence,
assurance, and security cooperation goals.

<a href= "pic119.html">Table 11.1 Essential Elements of Overseas Posture</a><br><br>


Changes Advisable to Consider Depending on Strategic Judgments
Barring a dramatic shift in the U.S. national security strategy, the current overseas
posture can continue to serve U.S. interests into the future. DoD has already made
significant reductions in its European posture. U.S. posture in Asia is shifting to
address the changing security environment in that region and new strategic priorities.
Enduring posture in the Middle East and Central Asia relies primarily on rotational
forces, base access, and prepositioned equipment and supplies. U.S. security goals in
Africa and Latin America are met through engagement, primarily by small, specialized
forces through deployments, rather than permanent presence. There are, however,
posture changes beyond those currently planned that could be reasonable to consider.
Table 11.2 summarizes existing posture elements that could merit more in-depth examination
for potential realignment depending on decisionmaker evaluations of the strategic
environment and judgments on priorities. Table 11.3 summarizes new elements
of posture that could merit pursuit depending on strategic evaluations and priorities.
If decisionmakers especially value deterrence and assurance, concentrating in
areas that position U.S. forces to respond to potential high-threat adversaries would be
most valuable, if these forces are not overly exposed and vulnerable to large and accurate
missile forces.

<a href= "pic120.html">Table 11.2 Elements of Overseas Posture That Could Be Evaluated for Realignment/Closure</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic121.html">Table 11.3 New Elements of Posture That Could Be Considered</a><br><br>

If decisionmakers especially value broad-based, intensive security cooperation,
then significant increases in rotations―force structure permitting―to Southeast Asia,
Eastern Europe, and Africa could be merited. Any significant reductions of permanent
forces and locations overseas would incur risk.


If reducing cost is the overriding priority, there are some options for realignment
for the United States to consider against forgone benefits: much of the remaining Army
presence in Europe; much of the Air Force presence in the UK and some of its forces
in Central Europe; the level of rotational presence in the Middle East; and Army, Air
Force, and, to a lesser degree, Marine Corps presence in Japan. These would entail significant
strategic trade-offs, particularly security cooperation in Europe and its periphery
and assurance in the Asia-Pacific region.

The following section assesses the three main overseas regions of U.S. military
presence to highlight the key policy questions for overseas posture, based on enduring
and evolving national security concerns.

	<b><a name="T3">Regional Considerations (Europe)</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Europe
In Europe, forces and bases have been reduced substantially, with planned cuts taking
USAREUR forces 90 percent below their Cold War peak and USAFE forces more than
75 percent below their Cold War peak. The deterrence needs in Europe have largely
waned, with Europe projected to remain relatively stable. Forces in Europe, though,
help to maintain NATO cohesion and still likely provide some assurance to partners in

Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, given their apprehension about the long-term trajectory
of Russia. There is some deployment-responsiveness advantage to be gained from
stationing forces in Europe for operations outside of Europe, but it is limited. However,
mobility bases, key communications nodes, and regional medical capabilities all support
intertheater responsiveness and sustainment and, thus, are critical. Bases in Central
and Southern Europe can support air operations around the periphery of Europe,
providing immediate response value, as do naval forces in the Mediterranean. However,
the ground forces based in Europe do not provide a significant deployment benefit
to other theaters. For instance, deploying an ABCT from Germany to Kuwait takes
about 18 days, only about four days quicker than a comparable force coming from the
east coast of the United States―assuming no delay waiting for an LMSR in Europe―
and, if a situation is time-sensitive, lighter units can be airlifted from CONUS in a
time span comparable to those for European-based units. The exception would be
response times for special operations forces or other small units conducting missions
in which mere hours matter. BMD capabilities fulfill commitments and provide assurance
to regional partners. Beyond these capabilities, U.S. forces play a significant role
in enabling security cooperation, but the amount and nature of security cooperation in
Europe that is necessary or advisable, particularly given the need to consider competing
requirements and resource constraints, presents a policy choice.
In short, for forces in Europe, the central question is: How much does U.S. presence
assure allies, and how much is security cooperation valued? Each service member
based in Europe costs about an additional $15,000C40,000 per year, depending on the
service, with fixed costs of each European installation costing between $115 million
and $210 million per year, due to factors such as the high cost of living, accompanied
tours, and lower levels of HNS than key Asian allies. Can substantial cuts beyond current
plans be made in Europe to reduce costs while
 maintaining sufficient alliance cohesion and interoperability with NATO partners?
 adequately developing capabilities of new partners?
 maintaining partner willingness to conduct operations outside of Europe when
the United States sees vital interests?
Three aspects of European-based posture contribute to security cooperation. The
first is advanced multinational training center capacity, exemplified by the JMTC in
Germany, which supports advanced military training with NATO partners and training
with emerging partners to improve their capabilities. For ground forces, training
facilities in Eastern Europe have also facilitated opportunities for the latter. For air
forces, there is the Warrior Preparation Center near Ramstein Air Force Base.
The second aspect is operational forces, both combat units and support or enabling
units. Fewer forces in Europe would lead to fewer security cooperation activities, as the marginal cost of such events is very low for forces stationed in Europe. Without continuous
presence, the opportunities for a broad range of security cooperation engagements
would decrease, with planning more difficult and greater lead times required. Additionally,
the direct expenses would be larger and more transparent, potentially depressing
the willingness to execute rotational deployments or small-scale security cooperation
activities. At the higher end, some of the unit-oriented tactical training could
be compensated for through rotational training, particularly if JMTC were retained.
But the ability to combine lower-level training events through the course of the year
would lessen. This second effect might be greater with enabling units that focus security
cooperation efforts on building specialized capabilities, such as logistics, medical,
air-ground operations, and intelligence units. The reduction would occur not only in
countries that host U.S. bases, but also in regions around Europe’s periphery, such as
Eastern Europe, Africa, and Central Asia.
The third aspect is forces that focus on the strategic and operational level of
engagement, such as headquarters units. A sizable reduction in forces would likely
lead to a downgrade of headquarters levels that would lessen senior leader engagement
activity. It would be possible to keep the command structure intact, though, to preserve
this capability, with forces being shifted to EUCOM and its components when
operational needs merit, much like CENTCOM.
We now turn to the spectrum of possibilities. The minimum permanent presence
in Europe must preserve bases to support air-based contingency response around the
periphery, mobility hubs, air and missile defense, communications capabilities, and
limited quick-response capability. As Figure 11.1 illustrates, to the extent that security
cooperation is less valued, further reductions could be made.

<a href= "pic122.html">Figure 11.1 Posture Tradespace in Europe</a><br><br>


The option that would go the furthest would restation most Army forces and
about half of the remaining Air Force units, while closing a number of bases―
including training facilities. The middle change option would reduce force structure
somewhat, removing an Army BCT and some enablers along with some Air Force consolidation.
A limited change option would consolidate a couple of Air Force bases. The
final option would be to make no changes beyond those already planned by the Army
and Air Force. In parallel with any of these, rotations could be increased or decreased
from those planned. High levels of rotations could make up for much of the forgone
unit-level tactical training, but with a significant reduction in the savings from reduced
permanent presence. It would also depend on keeping JMTC open or working out
agreements with allies to use their bases and training facilities.




The option shown in the bottom box of Figure 11.1 would greatly reduce security
cooperation activities and could affect assurance, but would reduce costs by about
$2 billion per year. Adding JMTC back in with increased Army and Air Force rotations
could mitigate the tactical-level reduction in interoperability and building new partner
capability effects, but would offset up to half of the savings. Savings for the second and third cases would be much smaller, ranging from $200 million to $500 million, with
fewer effects on security cooperation, especially if augmented with rotations.
At a higher level of strategic consideration, these forces have underpinned U.S.
relationships with partners in Europe. A posture that removed most forces would move
those relationships into uncharted waters, in which it would be difficult to predict
the consequences. This said, it should be noted that the United States has maintained
strong relationships elsewhere without strong presence, such as with Australia. Moreover,
force reductions could be partially (though not fully) mitigated with the provision
of more specialized capabilities such as cyber, missile defense, and special operations
forces.
In summary, if decisionmakers think only limited security cooperation with
European partners is needed to maintain interoperability and that strong relationships
can be maintained without a substantial permanent presence in Europe, then it could
be advisable to further reduce Army and Air Force presence in Europe, either to reduce
costs or to increase posture in other regions.



To support the national security strategy, a reduced permanent presence in Germany
would likely need to be accompanied by some level of increased rotations. This
direction would protect assets fundamental to formal European commitments, enable
increased rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific―if the resources were so redirected―
preserve the European links in the mobility infrastructure that enables global response,
and reflect calls in strategic guidance for a greater reliance on rotations and evolving
the European-based posture. The challenge would be ensuring that rotations and other
senior leader engagements remain sufficient to maintain interoperability and promote
the development of partners. Additionally, operational plans would have to be carefully
analyzed to determine whether any specific forces would need to be retained in Europe
and to otherwise incorporate greater use of U.S.-based forces.

	<b><a name="T4">Regional Considerations (The Pacific)</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The Pacific
The Pacific has grown substantially in its economic importance to the United States
in recent decades, and the United States seeks to continue to contribute to stability
in the region by engaging with partners and exploring ways to work bilaterally and
multilaterally to address security problems. The United States deters aggression from
North Korea, as it has for over 60 years, and pursues a number of security interests in
Southeast Asia, such as helping the Philippines to address insurgent threats and helping
Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore to maintain security in the Strait of Malacca.
China’s unsettled border disputes have flared up in recent years, and the United States
seeks to play a constructive role in preventing those disputes from spinning out of
control.
A major challenge to meeting deterrence and assurance goals with the current
basing structure is the emerging threat from long-range precision-guided weapons.
The majority of U.S. facilities in the region are in South Korea and Japan. All of these
facilities sit in the heaviest threat zones and face long-range threats from either North
Korea or China, or both. These weapons threaten air bases in particular, but can also
include variants designed to target surface ships and concentrated ground forces. The
geography of the Pacific narrows the options that can be considered because there are
so few suitable alternative operating locations in Northeast Asia.
The central questions for this region are as follows:
 Will increased presence in the Pacific strengthen deterrence, and how should posture
address the missile threat?
 What level and types of presence are most valuable?
 Should bases near China be dispersed, hardened, or reduced in response to the
missile threat?
 How much is security cooperation and assurance in the Asia-Pacific region valued?


In Japan, the U.S. homeports one aircraft carrier and numerous surface ships
at Yokosuka, with another major naval base at Sasebo, where an ARG resides. F-18
fighter aircraft are stationed at Atsuki and Iwakuni, with F-16s and P-3s at Misawa in
northern Japan. Finally, an airlift wing operates from Yokota airbase in Tokyo. In Okinawa,
Kadena Air Base is home to a composite wing that includes F-15 fighter aircraft
and a second air base used by the USMC, Futenma. Key elements of the 31st MEU
reside in Okinawa, with rotational units filling it out. Okinawa is also home to the
III MEF HQ Group, most of the First Marine Air Wing, the Third Marine Logistics
Group, and elements of the Third Marine Division, with additional infantry and aviation
detachment rotations from the United States.
For those who believe it necessary to maintain a forward presence at these locations
to deter and assure, despite threats from precision-guided weapons, there are
a few broad options. These facilities could be hardened and protected with missile
defenses or the number and mix of aircraft and ships could be reduced―either aiming
to restation them elsewhere in the Pacific or back to the United States, striking a balance
between assurance and operational resilience.1 Such measures would make these
bases less vulnerable―though certainly not invulnerable―to attack. Furthermore, in
the context of efforts to add capabilities to the Pacific region, it may not make sense
to add them to facilities in the highest threat zones. While clearly the intent of keeping
forces in a potentially vulnerable location is to bolster assurance and deterrence, if
doing so leaves U.S. forces open to a crippling attack, it might have the opposite effect.
Alternatively, the number and kinds of aircraft and ships that are based at these facilities
could be changed, again so as not to present such a lucrative target while yet retaining
military utility. For fighter aircraft, this problem could become more acute when
Joint Strike Fighters begin to enter the inventory, because the number of fighters in the
entire U.S. inventory will decline, potentially reducing the tolerance for accepting risks
to aircraft. Ships that homeport in high-threat zones are vulnerable in port, but with
sufficient attack warning can head to sea and reduce this vulnerability. So for ships,
assumptions about attack warnings are important in choosing among options. A final
option, dispersal to many bases, may be challenging given limited options for gaining
access to enough facilities to effectively dilute the inventory of attacking missiles.
Moreover, fighters require special facilities to handle weapons, which would need to be
provided at dispersed locations. There are more dispersal options with regard to large
support aircraft, which can operate from dual-use civilian airfields―often without any
special modifications to existing infrastructure. If such a strategy is pursued, it may
have implications for costs and U.S. requests for host-nation burden sharing, because it would involve a shift of resources to a larger number of facilities possibly located away
from close allies who have provided substantial HNS.2
For those who believe that the implications for deterrence and assurance would
be limited were there to be major changes to forces in Japan, the U.S. footprint could
be reduced. The United States has already developed plans and begun to shift forces to
Guam and other locations in the Pacific through restationing and the shifting of rotational
deployment locations. While some of these locations are still potentially under
some threat from Chinese missiles, the threat is qualitatively different from the threat
faced by forces in Japan or South Korea.
The Navy has moved some of its submarine force forward to Guam to increase
undersea presence in the Pacific. Similar moves may be warranted for the surface fleet,
particularly the carrier fleet, but also amphibious vessels and cruisers/destroyers. Forward
stationing of vessels is only one essential element to increase naval forward presence;
additional homeporting in the Pacific would also have to be tied to changes in
personnel and maintenance policies and schedules to achieve the maximum presence
benefit of overseas homeporting. So while forward stationing of assets can improve
availability to an extent, naval presence is more influenced by the size of the fleet
than the level of overseas basing. Were one to consider substantially increasing FDNF,
the benefits of increased naval presence and responsiveness would need to be weighed
against the financial costs and feasibility of aligning personnel, training, and maintenance
policies. So in the near term, increasing presence in the Pacific is likely to
demand reducing presence elsewhere.
Currently, the USMC posture in the Pacific is in transition. As agreed to with
Japan and Australia, the Marine Corps plans to reduce some forces in Okinawa, maintain
a rotational presence in northern Australia, establish a substantial presence in
Guam, and increase forces in Hawaii. DoD has set a policy goal of having 22,000
Marines based west of Hawaii.
For humanitarian response and security cooperation, the dedicated MEU/ARG
in the Pacific provides unique capabilities. Beyond the value of keeping the 31st MEU
in the Pacific, there seem to be several open questions regarding the USMC posture in
the Pacific. In addition to the 2,200-strong 31st MEU, over half of which is constituted
through rotations, there are substantial numbers of other ground, logistics, and MEF
headquarters group marines stationed or rotationally deployed to Okinawa, comprising
a substantial number of the 13,000 permanently stationed and 5,600 rotationally
deployed (when the UDPs are fully reinstituted) marines in Okinawa. However, the
absence of dedicated lift for the other ground and logistics forces makes their forward
position less of an advantage. If the forces are to fly to a contingency location to marry
up with equipment, their presence in Okinawa or elsewhere in the Western Pacific saves limited travel time. If they require maritime lift, that will have to come from
the United States, erasing the responsiveness advantage of forward presence, or from
the addition of dedicated, collocated maritime lift. In contrast, fixed-wing strike aircraft
in Japan can operate from home bases in the event of contingencies in the region
(although they could also deploy rapidly to expansible bases from the United States),
and rotary-wing aircraft can self-deploy from Okinawa within the region, but they
could not from CONUS. However, the Marine Corps may not want to station aircraft
units apart from ground forces.
The Marine Corps pays more to have forces forward stationed on Pacific islands
than in CONUS. The annual costs of keeping marines in Hawaii are a little higher
than in Japan, and costs in Guam are likely to be higher as well. In addition, construction
costs in Guam are the highest, although Japan has agreed to make a substantial
contribution to construction there. We estimate that restationing all but the MEU elements
and aviation units to CONUS (instead of potentially elsewhere in the Pacific)
and not reinstituting two of three UDP rotations (leaving just the one for the battalion
landing team and aviation detachment for the MEU) would save roughly $200 million
per year. In addition, construction costs are likely to be similar or lower in CONUS,
even considering the substantial contribution to construction in Guam for marines
that Japan has agreed to make.3
Thus, depending on how decisionmakers assess the benefit that additional Marine
Corps forces beyond the 31st MEU play in Okinawa or elsewhere in the Pacific, with
respect to assurance, security cooperation, and responsiveness, keeping them there
merits weighing against the somewhat higher costs, the lack of dedicated lift beyond
the one ARG, the potential threats to Okinawa from China, the opposition in some
quarters in Okinawa to a continued U.S. presence there, and the training limitations
for marines stationed there. Among these considerations, the biggest is likely to be how
it would affect Japanese and other regional nations’ perceptions of U.S. commitments
to the region. One possibility to ameliorate this risk would be to retain the III MEF
Command Element in the region to preserve frequent high-level engagement activities.
The broader decision to keep these forces in the Pacific also merits linkage to the Navy’s
force-structure considerations, particularly if the intention is to increase the presence of
MEU/ARGs or otherwise mobile MEU-sized MAGTFs in the Pacific, which might be
one, but not the only, objective. If so, the Navy might have to shift some of its amphibious
fleet to the Pacific. For training purposes, ideally USMC and USN forces preparing
to embark on a MEU/ARG would be located close enough to train together, but as
of the writing of this report, there are no plans to locate more amphibious ships near
Marine Corps forces in the western Pacific.
To guide these decisions, it may be helpful to consider what factors are being used
to guide and judge the Marine Corps posture in the Pacific. Currently, one guideline is the number of marines based west of the International Date Line. A more operational
metric might be considered to identify the operational capabilities and response times
desired, while still providing assurance.4 The expeditionary orientation of the Marine
Corps might make meeting presence, or at least responsiveness, goals through other
means than forward basing possible. For example, it may be that if greater Marine
Corps presence in the Pacific is desired, alternative deployment concepts, such as flying
marines from the United States for rotations on which they employ prepositioned
equipment stored in Southeast Asia, could meet policy intentions. Similarly, engagement
goals may be met by using units much smaller than MEU-sized MAGTFs, with
less-frequent large exercises with partners handled through deployments from the
United States. For example, if a country in Southeast Asia were to agree to allow joint
high-speed vessels port access, these might be used to transport smaller numbers of
marines within the region, who could fly from their home station to conduct regional
engagement rotations aboard these vessels.
In the Pacific, the United States is trying to improve responsiveness in Southeast
Asia with rotational forces in Singapore, the Philippines, and Australia. In addition,
this increases the number and frequency of security cooperation activities with Southeast
Asian partners. Whether policymakers view this as sufficient could have implications
for the overseas posture. If greater responsiveness or security cooperation is
desired, the Navy or Marine Corps presence in the region could be increased. If host
nations were willing, the USAF rotational presence in the region could be increased.
Such a rotational presence could help to increase the response capabilities of U.S. forces,
improve training benefits to regional partners, and help to better align security interests
in the region, but will come with increased costs. Finally, in South Korea, the U.S.
and South Korean governments are in the process of implanting a bilateral agreement
to consolidate U.S. forces. This consolidation will increase efficiency and reduce costs.
In the future, this consolidation could lead to vulnerability if North Korea invests substantially
in an accurate missile force, but to date it has not done so. The United States
has managed to continue to assure South Korea of its commitment to its security while
drawing down the number of forces stationed on the Korean Peninsula.
The U.S. has far-reaching goals in Asia, but its forces are concentrated in Northeast
Asia, where they are now within range of large numbers of precision-guided weapons.
In Northeast Asia, the question is how the United States can continue to both
deter potential foes and assure allies while making adjustments to reduce the chances
of catastrophic failure from attacks by precision-guided weapons. The problem is complex
enough that no one solution is likely to meet all the competing needs and fit within resource constraints. Therefore, if the United States still wants to maintain
forces in Northeast Asia, some combination of hardening, active defenses, dispersal,
and changes to the mix of forces that are exposed to the highest threats will likely be
in order. These adjustments would likely require substantial investments in infrastructure.
At the same time, the United States wants to strengthen the security partnerships
it maintains in South and Southeast Asia, but for now that will have to be accomplished
through rotational presence. Rotational presence can be more cost-effective
than permanent presence if rotations provide partial-year presence or are of long duration
(assuming sufficient force structure to support such presence), but can be more
expensive under some conditions. At present in this area, only rotational presence is
viable in the near term; so in this case, there is no cost trade-off to consider. If greater
security cooperation is desired, some permanent presence in Southeast Asia in the long
term may be the most cost-effective means to meet that need, but that would depend
on finding a willing host nation, which the United States could pursue through relationship-
building steps. Alternatively, more arrangements like the recent agreements
with Australia, Singapore, and the Philippines, which allow regular access but not permanent
presence, may meet security cooperation goals for the region.
Overall, modest reductions in the Asia-Pacific Region could produce some savings
while preserving in-place forces in South Korea and some additional capabilities
in Japan for broader regional security. These reductions would include some of the
Marine Corps forces and an Air Force base and wing, contributing roughly equal
amounts of up to roughly $450 million per year. However, the nature and size of these
reductions would depend on how decisionmakers judge the likely impact of modest
force reductions in Asia on regional perceptions of the U.S. commitment to the region,
how critical they believe large in-place forces are to deterrence, and the degree to which
forces should be kept in higher-threat zones. But these modest reductions would reflect
the call for pursuing new approaches to defense in the face of resource constraints. Any
of these steps, though, might appear incompatible with the U.S. government’s stated
intention to rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific region, even if alternative approaches
could provide similar capabilities. Concerted efforts to explain to allies how security
could still be provided would have to be made, with some risk of not fully assuring key
U.S. allies in the region.
Alternatively, emphasizing different aspects of the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance
could lead to increased presence in Asia and the Pacific. If increased security
cooperation in South and Southeast Asia is highly valued and increases in rotational
presence are pursued, costs would increase. If done, however, in combination with
modest reductions in Northeast Asia, costs in the greater region might be held relatively
steady. If such rotations were added while maintaining or even increasing presence
oriented toward meeting perceived needs to increase assurance and deterrence,
then annual recurring costs in the region would increase, potentially substantially. Any
costs for hardening of facilities would be in addition to the cost estimates in the report. 

The region presents a complex set of judgments and trade-offs regarding assurance,
deterrence, security cooperation, and risks, with a range of options corresponding to
different judgments on how different posture choices are likely to affect these factors.

	<b><a name="T5">Regional Considerations (Middle East)</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
As noted in the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance, U.S. defense efforts in the Middle
East will be aimed at countering violent extremists, upholding commitments to allies
and partner states, and addressing the enduring concerns of the proliferation of ballistic
missiles and nuclear weapons. In supporting these objectives “the United States
will continue to place a premium on U.S. and allied military presence in―and support
of―partner nations in and around this region.”5 The United States has a diverse
network of air bases that provide a range of capabilities in the Persian Gulf region
and are complemented by maritime capabilities that also provide enduring regional
presence. In the Persian Gulf, the United States has an interest in preventing Iran
from disrupting commerce in the region, seeking to politically pressure or destabilize
neighboring states, or (in the future) threatening regional states with nuclear coercion.
U.S. facilities in the Persian Gulf region tend to be located in wealthy states that have
overlapping interests with the United States, particularly regarding the free flow of
natural resources. In other areas, U.S. interests and policies do not overlap with those
of the host nation, particularly regarding U.S. relations with Israel, and potentially over
human rights and political representation. There is public information that several host
nations in the region provide burden sharing; as shown in Chapter Seven, Kuwait and
Qatar have a history of helping to offset basing costs.
Basing in the region traditionally has involved trade-offs between the need to
deter adversaries and reassure partners while also weighing political sensitivities to the
U.S. military presence in host nations. While the wind-down of the conflicts in Iraq
and Afghanistan have reduced the need for major combat and support assets in the
region, enduring concerns over Iran continue to heavily motivate U.S. force presence.
The Arab Spring has added another element of uncertainty to the internal political
dynamics in many states, which could create a perceived need for presence to respond
to new crises, but could lead to difficulties in maintaining U.S. presence. So in many
respects the United States continues to face the balance between adequate force presence
to secure national objectives and political risk to sustain those forces.
Overall, the central question for this region is how responsiveness and deterrence
needs in the Persian Gulf should be weighed against the potential for political tensions
and risks.
More specifically, the posture in the region, particularly in the Persian Gulf,
involves judgments on some key aspects of that presence, representing the tradespace
for consideration. The United States currently maintains substantial forces on a rotational basis in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE. The presence in Kuwait of 13,500
military personnel (mostly Army),6 serves several functions, including providing staging
hubs and logistical support for contingencies, storage for prepositioned equipment
for contingency response, assurance to the Kuwaitis and others of a U.S. commitment
to defend the region, and capabilities for security cooperation and training among
GCC partners. In the Kingdom of Bahrain, the U.S. Fifth Fleet HQ at Manama has
plans to expand U.S. naval facilities, including plans to station up to eight LCSs. Qatar
hosts the U.S. air base at Al Udeid. The UAE provides a number of facilities for U.S.
forces operating in the region, and both the USAF and the USN benefit from access
to UAE territory. The airbase at Al Dhafra, along with the Air Warfare Center there,
provides extensive opportunities for training and security cooperation with Gulf air
forces. The UAE also hosts the Integrated Air Missile Defense Center, again providing
training for various GCC members.
These roles need to be weighed against the political risks of maintaining this level
of presence and the deterrent and response benefits, as well as the costs. To the extent
that the presence provides deterrence and assurance, enables capabilities for possible
contingencies, involves minimal political risk, and includes substantial burden sharing
by Gulf states, it will be an important contribution to stability. One of the key questions
involves the political risks associated with the presence in these countries, some
of which, like Bahrain, are dealing with their own internal challenges. Future changes
in the threat environment or in the political risks from the presence could alter this calculation
and represent an area for possible future adjustments. Any reduction in force
presence could be mitigated by retaining or adding prepositioned material. This would
provide considerable responsiveness to a range of contingencies. This approach could
also possibly reduce local political sensitivities associated with the troop presence.
Traditionally, the United States has maintained a limited-visibility military presence
in the Middle East that consisted almost entirely of prepositioned equipment and
contingency access to partner military facilities. It appears as if the exigencies of deterring
Iran and assuring U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf is pushing the United States away
from this strategy in favor of a more force-intensive―although largely rotational―
presence. However, given the ability of the United States to maintain a maritime presence
in and deploy forces relatively quickly to the region, it is not clear whether the
United States needs to maintain substantial force levels in the Persian Gulf to meet
these objectives. For example, while not a perfect analogy, forces have been drawn
down in South Korea while still assuring an ally and without prompting aggression,
suggesting that revisiting force needs could merit consideration.
Finally, a foreign military presence has always been a sensitive political issue for
many Middle Eastern countries. If a host-nation government faces the prospect of significant internal unrest, decisionmakers may want to carefully weigh whether they
continue to make investments to military facilities and base forces in that nation. Political
instability could well result in diminished or lost American access.
Figure 11.2 provides a spectrum of possible options for U.S. presence in the Persian
Gulf region, taking various factors into account. As noted on the left side of the
figure, one factor to consider in determining the level and type of presence is perceptions
about the threats that need to be countered and the associated forces critical to
both deter and provide rapid response to those threats. However, increasing force could
also be in tension with political considerations in the region. The top tier reflects a
robust presence for deterring and countering major regional contingencies. It consists
both of substantial prepositioning and a heavy rotational presence involving air and
missile defense assets, Army units, MEFs, AEWs, and an enduring USN presence. This
top-tier presence would perform well in terms of responsiveness and deterrence, but
comes with increased financial costs to the United States. For example, annual ABCT
rotations to the region are estimated to cost about $200 million per year, maintaining
continuous presence of a composite 90-aircraft AEW costs about $300 million
per year, and quarterly fighter-squadron rotations would be $50C100 million per year,
depending on the aircraft types and how the rotations are executed (and not including
the costs of any needed increases in force structure to provide a sufficient rotation base).
Harder to gauge are the potential political risks, the willingness of regional leaders to
accept this presence, and the problems that such a significant sustained presence could
pose to partner states. This could come from domestic sources, where such presence
could spur opposition to the regimes in the host nations, from other states, or from nonstate actors in the region. This is likely to be a function of many factors, including
the degree to which partners and the United States share common concerns over the
threats to be countered.

The middle tier represents a reduction in presence and cost relative to the top-tier
option. Army rotations to Kuwait would be reduced or eliminated, with continued
or increased emphasis on prepositioning. The planned Navy expansion in Bahrain
would be deferred. Under this option, responsiveness and forward deterrence would be
reduced, although this would be a function of the threats to be countered. If major contingencies,
including Iran, were no longer viewed as primary concerns, then a reduced
presence as illustrated in this mid-tier option would not necessarily erode responsiveness
and deterrence. It could also serve to reduce sources of political opposition in host
states to a sizable U.S. military presence in the region.
The third tier would further reduce the routine presence in the Persian Gulf region
and instead focus on maintaining access to host-nation facilities as needed. This would
result in additional cost savings and possible political benefits from further reducing
routine U.S. presence. Again, these potential benefits would have to be weighed against
the threats and the corresponding impact on deterrence and assurance. A reduced
presence of this scale could risk both increasing the chances of adversary aggression
and undermining the confidence of regional partners in the U.S. commitment to their
security. To the extent that latent state threats become acute on short notice, the United
States would be less well positioned to respond quickly.
All of the tiered options involve trade-offs and are highly contingent on regional
developments and dynamics. The degree of risk assumed in each is likewise contingent.
Depending on how decisionmakers assess deterrence needs in the region and the role of
forward posture in meeting them versus how they assess the risks of creating political
tensions or a backlash in the region would lead to choices on different points along the
spectrum. Depending on the weight given to the two competing sets of factors, decisionmakers
could elect to selectively reduce rotations in the region, maintain the status
quo, or seek to increase rotations to the region across the services.

	<b><a name="T6">Value Perceptions and Priorities Are Critical to Posture Decisions</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
There are some clear limits to how far consolidation in the U.S. overseas posture could
be pursued, beyond which achieving national security goals and executing the 2012
Defense Strategic Guidance would become untenable. There is a minimum threshold
of foreign posture that the United States must retain. Beyond that, there is additional
posture that is almost certainly advisable to retain or even add. As described in this
chapter, there are a number of choices specific to each region, where different judgments
could lead to differing calculations of the advisability of reductions, additions,
or changes in the nature of posture. Again, the three illustrative postures presented in this report represent policy options, not right or wrong choices, because only the
cost side of the equation can be determined with precision. Decisions will reflect judgments
based on the perceived values of the competing goals―how they should be
prioritized―and the degree to which overseas posture is perceived to advance those
goals.
